Mic quality need to be improved, there is sparkle voice of other person while on speakers 4. No charger, no back cover, i think when we buy expensive phone, we deserve both of them.. 5. rest things just fine, will add on review if get anything else..\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Received this beauty on 27 Feb 2023 and hands down to the performance of the phone. This is my first Samsung phone and I am very impressed. The images are spot on, stable videos and can shoot in 8k is a big plus for me. As the gen 2 is very power efficient my phone with moderate usage easily last around a day which is very impressive by a compact smart phone. Cream color is like a treat to watch. Just close your eyes and grab this amazing product by Samsung.\n",
      "Rating: 4, Review: Nice phone with best camera. Face id recognization average..\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: Great phone, lovely weight balance. The in hand feel is amazing it's so lite that I barely feel it in my pocket. The images from the camera are decent too in every lighting condition. I have attached some samples with this review. I'm very satisfied with the phone. I do get around 5-6 hour of SOT which is pretty good for a phone of this size. The screen is bright and vibrant which is expected from a Samsung. I would definitely recommend if you are looking for a tiny and complete phone with all the bells and whistles.\n",

      "Rating: 4, Review: Amazing camera. Loved the design and look and feel of the phone. Battery could have been better. However it works for me. Light weight as well. Overall its a really good phone. Didnt like iphone much from the store. Moreover it felt like I am giving up too many features in iphone and the price range is similar.  Hence got the s23 and I absolutely love this phone.\n",

      "Rating: 4, Review: User experience is amazing. Display and performance are top notch! Camera is also really nice, best part, photos are natural. The only draw back is battery backup and heating issue, if these two things were better this would have been the best flagship in this range.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: Don't panic, for couple of days battery will drain very fast and phone would be heating a lot. Once updated to latest software version above issues would get resolved. PROS: compact handy phone, call quality excellent, internet connectivity stable and fast, camera excellent, AI features, Samsung proprietary features like Galaxy watch, wallet, store, Knox support CONS: battery will last a day on average to medium use, no charger provided in the box charging time almost 90 min for 3900 mAH battery, for couple of days it tends to fall down due to compact size and weight as compared to regular 6.7 inch phones. VERDICT: at 43K for 256GB variant it's worth to have a flagship phone from Samsung.\n",

      "Rating: 4, Review: Writing brutally honest review  I have been using this beast for the last 2 weeks so I have pretty much experienced everything.  I wanted a compact phone for work purposes and my usage includes 30+ calls in a day , 8-10 emails , opening 2-3 sheets as and when required. While I was searching for a compact and powerful device almost everyone suggested that I go for an iPhone 13/14. But since I've used apple I was more inclined towards Android and there're hardly any options available in Android when it comes to compact size.  Coming back to my experience.  Battery -This phone gives me excellent battery back-up. I charge it in the morning around 9.30 am which continues till next day noon around 2-3pm which is fantabulous.  Camera - used it very less though but clicked some images and compared it with the OnePlus 10 pro and iphone 14 , trust me both have failed in front of this small beast.  Heating - never faced any heating issues till now even during long calls.  I think the above 3 are major parameters on which people decide their purchase.  Bottom line - if you have a budget then go for it. You won't regret it.\n",

      "Rating: 4, Review: EDIT: Review after 17 months usage There are hundreds of reviews for this device so let me get straight to the pros and cons as a normal user. Cons: 1. Battery life is not as great as many reviewers say, I'm not a heavy user but if I'm traveling and using phone data the device doesn't even last a day. A hard reset did help improving the battery performance but still it hardly lasts a day. 2. Samsung is providing 45W charging speed for the Plus and Ultra models but only 25W for S23, this is disappointing considering the phone is expensive. 3. Screen is usable in sunlight but it is not as bright as competition.  Pros 1. The camera, is hands down one the best in the market. See with still photos many Android phone makers are doing a great job even at half the price of S23 so I won't say that it is worth the price for stills but in videos, it absolutely shines and the results are worth every penny. 2. Performance is just great, SD 8gen 2 is great while shooting long timelapse, editing videos, and playing games...it does get warm but it is normal. I'm glad Samsung skipped Exynos for S23. 3. Design-wise the phone is pretty simple and geometrical with no gimmicks. Its size is perfect for one-hand use. Also, I love the new standardized look Samsung is going with all of its phones. 4. The flagship experience is best with Samsung. A 4-year software update means you get to enjoy the device for a long-long time. 5. Samsung's ecosystem is getting really good, if you're using more Samsung devices and Windows PC then you get something closer to Apple's Ecosystem. Phone-Link app works perfectly to transfer images, manage calls and even use phone as a webcam. 6. With One UI 6.1 the software experience has become even better. The phone feels way more polished now.  At current market price S23 is highly recommended.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: I've used it for a month now and I can say one thing for sure, This is the best phone I've used till now. I've got it for 40k after offers and exchange and I've never had a regret once. Ultra may have more advanced features, but me as a fan of handy phones, S23 feels right for me.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: The phone is awesome,I got this by 52k.But it is worth the price. Display is awesome Indisplay finger print is very much responsive Battery backup is ok for one day use Camera performance is top notch Portrait mode is like Dslr cameras Night mode is also good Videography is good Good refresh rate One hand phone Only drawbacks are no charger inside the box we have to purchase separately Charging speed is more than 1 hour to full charge.\n",
      "Rating: 4, Review: I got this product at 38k in big billon 128gb variant. At this price i will say i got best smartphone.  Probs 1) excellent design. 2) light weight pocket frendly device. 3) good camera 4) performance is really excellent.  Cons- 1) videography in night not gets good results. 2) little bit heating issue there if you use this device without case. But highlighting that heating issue does not affect to its performance. Thinking it is compact phone small heating problem is ignorable.    Average point 1) battery backup - you will get around 6 hrs battery backup. Now according to you you think is it sufficient to you or not but inwould say as a compact phone this is the best battery backup. If you use power 🔋 saving mode then trust me it is providing such a best results . (Performance will be down)     Charging time take around 1 hr using 25w original adapter. This was a review from my side. Thank you\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: The best small size phone (6.1 inch display) I have used.  It's a Samsung flagship and they have got almost everything right - Fantastic cameras, Awesome AI, Amazing and Premium Display, Design, Size, Smooth and Excellent to use and to a good extent, even for high resource usage tasks. Battery consumption is also very well optimised and charges at a good speed.  The only minor improvement per me could be, a slightly higher capacity battery and faster charging.  Highly recommended S23, if you prefer a smaller and compact phone. With deals and offers, if you are able to get this for less than 45k, it's really worth.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: I upgraded to this from Redmi Note 4, so it is a very significant upgrade for me. Phone is fast, super responsive with no lag at all which is what you expect from a Snapdragon 8 gen 2 for Galaxy. I got 256 GB variant, so I have UFS 4.0 storage. Best camera and display, design wise looks awesome with thin and even bezels. Phone is a bit small which is perfect for my small palm but that means battery is also small and gives around 6 hours of screen on time. If you are just watching downloaded videos, you can get 9-10 hours of screen on time. One UI is awesome, just waiting for 6.1 to try out the AI for Galaxy. Overall a well balanced and powerful phone.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Overall very good phone. if you use your mobile extensively then battery MAY disappoint you. For me battery is enough to survive whole day.  Camera is good. it will take pictures close to reality. if you are relame/poco/oppo and other Chinese phone user and planning to switch to samsung then be mindful that camera selfi will take your real photo and will not apply lipstick and makeup and you may end up hating you own face.  In performance department as well it is excellent.  while charging phone get worm which is expected.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: This is really compact monster 😍 everytime feels excited to holding this phone in hand. Don't bother about battery life, it gives easily more than 1 day and there are wok around to improve the battery life - manage the performance profile switching from standard to light, and select 60hrtz refresh rate, and I am not a gamer, and hence for daily usage battery is sufficient, Samsung provides 4 years security and OS updates, camera clarity is very good, audio- cristal clear, oueUI is awesome, i was using Samsung M51 before, was sceptical between iPhone 14 as price is almost same, but iPhone is just show off, and only brand. Just go for it if you have budget, and don't bother on negative reviews.\n",

Processor, display, camera all are outstanding. So decision is yours, if you can sacrifise little bit on battery then go for it without a second thought.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: Writing this review after using for 6 months Pros: Camera quality is impressive especially Portait mode.. The quality of images are similar to DSLR camera. Phone is smooth and it works like a magic. Cons: As this is compact phone.. typing something needs more care.. lot of typi mistakes by using tge small keyboard. Fingerprint doesn't work sometimes.Had to to try multiple times. Battery drains faster..always need to carry backup or charger with you.\n",

And Lastly,both of the UI's are great .\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: Pros- 1. Battery is surprisingly good for a compact form factor. 2. OneUI is so well polished for this S23. And excellent software update support. 3. Camera is one of the best in the industry. 4. Snapdragon 8 Gen2 is a beast. Powerful as well as efficient.  Cons- 1. Can get warm sometime. 2. Charging speed is slow at 25W, should have been 45W instead.  Verdict- Best is class (Compact True Flagship)\n",
      "Rating: 4, Review: After almost 15 days of usage, Samsung S23 has lived up to my expectations. The obvious pros are its compact form factor and splendid display. During the initial few days of usage, the phone does get warm along the metal frame while multitasking or using heavy apps, but that has settled down now with continuous optimization. It still gets slightly warm but nothing too alarming. One suggestion for those users who take a lot of pictures or videos is that the 128 GB may seem to be a little short in storage. The AI based stuff already consumes quite a bit of space with regular software updates.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Mobile is fantastic. the best feature is its size. The camera works well, and UI experience is also good. The only concern is its battery and heating issue, I have been using this mobile for 1 week, and the heating issue always persists. We can get the battery until 8 pm. in moderate usage. I am never playing games on mobile. Display is top notch even better than the iPhone 14 pro. S23 Phone is better in so many segments compared to iPhone 14 pro. It never hangs, even if we use so many applications at a time. UI is 💯. Screenshot, call recorder,screen recorder, and 30X Zoom we will not get in iPhone 14 pro. Pros of mobile Display UI Lots of useful galaxy apps Network reception Call quality Compact size.  Cons. Battery backup Heating issue Huge price drop after 1 year.  Flipkart mobile exchange is very smooth, and they have given the best deal. I exchanged my oneplus with Rs 14000 and got a bank discount Rs. 8000 and prepaid offer got discount of Rs. 5000.  Thank you, flipkart, for providing such fantastic deals.\n",

I am not a heavy user and don't play games on small screen due to which i get excellent battery backup. I charge only once in a day and that too not 100%. Still i get entire day backp.  3. S23 series also got Samsung AI features so not much missing on anything which is there in S24 series.  S23 has Snapdragon 8 gen 2 processor compared to S24 and S24 plus. They have Exynos proc which is decent but not the best.  Very happy with this purchase. I will recommend this device at the price point which i got. It is best deal anyone can get.  Hope this review helps.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: I have been using this mobile for a while now. Here's my honest review based on my experience.  Battery Performance: The battery life on this mobile is quite impressive under moderate usage. It easily lasts a full day. However, I noticed that when using the 5G network, the battery drains heavily. This is common for all phones not a Samsung issue.  Design and Build: The slim design of the mobile is a major plus point. It fells comfortable to hold and is suitable for single hand usage. However, I noticed that the paint on aluminium frame is starting to wear off, which is disappointing. It's something that Samsung should address for better durability.  Camera: The camera, especially when using the portrait mode, captures good images with nice depth of field. However, I did notice a lack of clarity when zooming in on subjects.  Expert Raw Option: For photography enthusiasts or professionals, the expert RAW option is a standout feature. It provides more control and flexibility over the image settings, allowing for advanced editing and post- processing.  I hope this review helps you make an informed decision. Happy shopping!\n",
      "Rating: 3, Review: Product is good Cons: While using cam heating issue Battery back up less When we bought with 70K they should provide case and charming adoptor, but no case no charging adopotor  Pros: processor, cam, display, design, looks premium.  Note: When I try to sign in some other 2 numbers also coming that means it is used one. Where ever mobile number is required it is showing 2 other numbers which is not mine. Also I have seen a very minor scratch at the top of phone. Flipkart simply cheated customers.  So buyers, When you are buying expensive phones be careful and buy offline. My best suggestion.\n",

Performance is on the another level I don't game lot and afterall it isn't a gaming device.it doesn't compromise And the main thing everyone is complaining about is the battery. So in my experience many of those guys doesn't used any flagship device before. This phone is compact and everything is packed in right here. Right now i use my device in max settings nothing is turned off.even though it has a smaller battery i do get 6hr of screen on time at the end of the day and 27%charge remains Which is great. And my device doesn't heat that much till now,but it gets warm when it is charging which is so obvious. After it is all aluminum so it do feel warm Till now everything is good....\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Pros 1)CAMERA- 5 out of 5. The ultrawide camera can get a little work done because in some environment photos seems a little dark then main camera. 2)DISPLAY- 5 OUT 5. The display is stunning and that 120hz is criminally smooth. 3)BATTERY- 4.5 out of 5. 3900mah feels good Enough for me .But a little bit more mah and it would me much appreciated. 4)SOUND- 4 OUT OF 5. With dolby atmos stereo speakers sounds great. But the bass seems a little low than its bigger sibling s23+. 5)STORAGE AND RAM- 5 OUT 5. 256gb variant is good enough for me and also because this variant comes with ufs 4.0 the overall experience is way better. And with 8gb ram everday task is just seamless with this much ram i have stopped the habit of removing apps from recent you can just use a app and then press home button and then go of with your day and when you want you can retrieve the same app from where you left on next day and also with ram you extend it upto 16gb. 6)PERFORMANCE- 5 OUT 5 . SNAPDRAGON 8 GEN 2 performs great. And i dont think i have to tell how good day to day task performs. So i will go on heavy task the only heavy task i do is playing genshin and yeah it you can play it on high settings at 30 fps yeah it does get a little bit of frame drops and hitches but overall it performs good if you play it on mid settings it goes pretty well the only problem what gets in way is battery backup but it also gets solves if you play it on low settings and if you do that you can get a play time of almost 3 hours on full charge easy.\n",

Gameplay(bgmi/genshin) great. Wont lag much, might see some frame drops in bgmi customs otherwise no. Look and feel is very premium especially for the green color. Compared to apple 120 refresh rate is great. We have telephoto zoom. Comparable battery life. No lags while using the phone.  Cons: UI can use some improvements. Picture and picture mode can be improved. Can give 90 hz feature also (force or adaptive). Battery is good, but it can get better.  Will update if i find some more pros and cons.\n",

I tried everything including software update,changing the network closing background tabs etc. I mean i will be okay if the heating issue is happening while gaming but it gets hot just for using social media and that is a problem. A big drawback since it has one of the best processor i didn't expect this. And it has some glitches while using some apps. I mean for a 50k phone this is not something that i signed up for. Disappointed with the purchase.\n",

Great camera quality and great video recording capabilities thanks to super stabilised video.  Battery is great too if you don't Play too much heavy games then it will last whole day.  Display is the best in the segment super bright and punchy, colours are just awesome ofcourse it is a Samsung display.  Man the processor.... What a great processor built by Qualcomm. Super powerful and battery efficient. You can throw any task it doesn't matter.  Everything is good you can go for it only the price a little higher side... If that is not your concern you can just blindly go for it.\n",

Mic quality need to be improved, there is sparkle voice of other person while on speakers 4. No charger, no back cover, i think when we buy expensive phone, we deserve both of them.. 5. rest things just fine, will add on review if get anything else..\n",

The images are spot on, stable videos and can shoot in 8k is a big plus for me. As the gen 2 is very power efficient my phone with moderate usage easily last around a day which is very impressive by a compact smart phone. Cream color is like a treat to watch. Just close your eyes and grab this amazing product by Samsung.\n",

The images from the camera are decent too in every lighting condition. I have attached some samples with this review. I'm very satisfied with the phone. I do get around 5-6 hour of SOT which is pretty good for a phone of this size. The screen is bright and vibrant which is expected from a Samsung. I would definitely recommend if you are looking for a tiny and complete phone with all the bells and whistles.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Don't panic, for couple of days battery will drain very fast and phone would be heating a lot. Once updated to latest software version above issues would get resolved. PROS: compact handy phone, call quality excellent, internet connectivity stable and fast, camera excellent, AI features, Samsung proprietary features like Galaxy watch, wallet, store, Knox support CONS: battery will last a day on average to medium use, no charger provided in the box charging time almost 90 min for 3900 mAH battery, for couple of days it tends to fall down due to compact size and weight as compared to regular 6.7 inch phones. VERDICT: at 43K for 256GB variant it's worth to have a flagship phone from Samsung.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: great picture quality just wow... powerful performance ....only heting problem\n",
      "Rating: 4, Review: Writing brutally honest review  I have been using this beast for the last 2 weeks so I have pretty much experienced everything.  I wanted a compact phone for work purposes and my usage includes 30+ calls in a day , 8-10 emails , opening 2-3 sheets as and when required. While I was searching for a compact and powerful device almost everyone suggested that I go for an iPhone 13/14. But since I've used apple I was more inclined towards Android and there're hardly any options available in Android when it comes to compact size.  Coming back to my experience.  Battery -This phone gives me excellent battery back-up. I charge it in the morning around 9.30 am which continues till next day noon around 2-3pm which is fantabulous.  Camera - used it very less though but clicked some images and compared it with the OnePlus 10 pro and iphone 14 , trust me both have failed in front of this small beast.  Heating - never faced any heating issues till now even during long calls.  I think the above 3 are major parameters on which people decide their purchase.  Bottom line - if you have a budget then go for it. You won't regret it.\n",

      "Rating: 4, Review: EDIT: Review after 17 months usage There are hundreds of reviews for this device so let me get straight to the pros and cons as a normal user. Cons: 1. Battery life is not as great as many reviewers say, I'm not a heavy user but if I'm traveling and using phone data the device doesn't even last a day. A hard reset did help improving the battery performance but still it hardly lasts a day. 2. Samsung is providing 45W charging speed for the Plus and Ultra models but only 25W for S23, this is disappointing considering the phone is expensive. 3. Screen is usable in sunlight but it is not as bright as competition.  Pros 1. The camera, is hands down one the best in the market. See with still photos many Android phone makers are doing a great job even at half the price of S23 so I won't say that it is worth the price for stills but in videos, it absolutely shines and the results are worth every penny. 2. Performance is just great, SD 8gen 2 is great while shooting long timelapse, editing videos, and playing games...it does get warm but it is normal. I'm glad Samsung skipped Exynos for S23. 3. Design-wise the phone is pretty simple and geometrical with no gimmicks. Its size is perfect for one-hand use. Also, I love the new standardized look Samsung is going with all of its phones. 4. The flagship experience is best with Samsung. A 4-year software update means you get to enjoy the device for a long-long time. 5. Samsung's ecosystem is getting really good, if you're using more Samsung devices and Windows PC then you get something closer to Apple's Ecosystem. Phone-Link app works perfectly to transfer images, manage calls and even use phone as a webcam. 6. With One UI 6.1 the software experience has become even better. The phone feels way more polished now.  At current market price S23 is highly recommended.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: I've used it for a month now and I can say one thing for sure, This is the best phone I've used till now. I've got it for 40k after offers and exchange and I've never had a regret once. Ultra may have more advanced features, but me as a fan of handy phones, S23 feels right for me.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: The phone is awesome,I got this by 52k.But it is worth the price. Display is awesome Indisplay finger print is very much responsive Battery backup is ok for one day use Camera performance is top notch Portrait mode is like Dslr cameras Night mode is also good Videography is good Good refresh rate One hand phone Only drawbacks are no charger inside the box we have to purchase separately Charging speed is more than 1 hour to full charge.\n",
      "Rating: 4, Review: I got this product at 38k in big billon 128gb variant. At this price i will say i got best smartphone.  Probs 1) excellent design. 2) light weight pocket frendly device. 3) good camera 4) performance is really excellent.  Cons- 1) videography in night not gets good results. 2) little bit heating issue there if you use this device without case. But highlighting that heating issue does not affect to its performance. Thinking it is compact phone small heating problem is ignorable.    Average point 1) battery backup - you will get around 6 hrs battery backup. Now according to you you think is it sufficient to you or not but inwould say as a compact phone this is the best battery backup. If you use power 🔋 saving mode then trust me it is providing such a best results . (Performance will be down)     Charging time take around 1 hr using 25w original adapter. This was a review from my side. Thank you\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: The best small size phone (6.1 inch display) I have used.  It's a Samsung flagship and they have got almost everything right - Fantastic cameras, Awesome AI, Amazing and Premium Display, Design, Size, Smooth and Excellent to use and to a good extent, even for high resource usage tasks. Battery consumption is also very well optimised and charges at a good speed.  The only minor improvement per me could be, a slightly higher capacity battery and faster charging.  Highly recommended S23, if you prefer a smaller and compact phone. With deals and offers, if you are able to get this for less than 45k, it's really worth.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: I upgraded to this from Redmi Note 4, so it is a very significant upgrade for me. Phone is fast, super responsive with no lag at all which is what you expect from a Snapdragon 8 gen 2 for Galaxy. I got 256 GB variant, so I have UFS 4.0 storage. Best camera and display, design wise looks awesome with thin and even bezels. Phone is a bit small which is perfect for my small palm but that means battery is also small and gives around 6 hours of screen on time. If you are just watching downloaded videos, you can get 9-10 hours of screen on time. One UI is awesome, just waiting for 6.1 to try out the AI for Galaxy. Overall a well balanced and powerful phone.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Overall very good phone. if you use your mobile extensively then battery MAY disappoint you. For me battery is enough to survive whole day.  Camera is good. it will take pictures close to reality. if you are relame/poco/oppo and other Chinese phone user and planning to switch to samsung then be mindful that camera selfi will take your real photo and will not apply lipstick and makeup and you may end up hating you own face.  In performance department as well it is excellent.  while charging phone get worm which is expected.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: This is really compact monster 😍 everytime feels excited to holding this phone in hand. Don't bother about battery life, it gives easily more than 1 day and there are wok around to improve the battery life - manage the performance profile switching from standard to light, and select 60hrtz refresh rate, and I am not a gamer, and hence for daily usage battery is sufficient, Samsung provides 4 years security and OS updates, camera clarity is very good, audio- cristal clear, oueUI is awesome, i was using Samsung M51 before, was sceptical between iPhone 14 as price is almost same, but iPhone is just show off, and only brand. Just go for it if you have budget, and don't bother on negative reviews.\n",

Processor, display, camera all are outstanding. So decision is yours, if you can sacrifise little bit on battery then go for it without a second thought.\n",

And Lastly,both of the UI's are great .\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: Pros- 1. Battery is surprisingly good for a compact form factor. 2. OneUI is so well polished for this S23. And excellent software update support. 3. Camera is one of the best in the industry. 4. Snapdragon 8 Gen2 is a beast. Powerful as well as efficient.  Cons- 1. Can get warm sometime. 2. Charging speed is slow at 25W, should have been 45W instead.  Verdict- Best is class (Compact True Flagship)\n",
      "Rating: 4, Review: After almost 15 days of usage, Samsung S23 has lived up to my expectations. The obvious pros are its compact form factor and splendid display. During the initial few days of usage, the phone does get warm along the metal frame while multitasking or using heavy apps, but that has settled down now with continuous optimization. It still gets slightly warm but nothing too alarming. One suggestion for those users who take a lot of pictures or videos is that the 128 GB may seem to be a little short in storage. The AI based stuff already consumes quite a bit of space with regular software updates.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Mobile is fantastic. the best feature is its size. The camera works well, and UI experience is also good. The only concern is its battery and heating issue, I have been using this mobile for 1 week, and the heating issue always persists. We can get the battery until 8 pm. in moderate usage. I am never playing games on mobile. Display is top notch even better than the iPhone 14 pro. S23 Phone is better in so many segments compared to iPhone 14 pro. It never hangs, even if we use so many applications at a time. UI is 💯. Screenshot, call recorder,screen recorder, and 30X Zoom we will not get in iPhone 14 pro. Pros of mobile Display UI Lots of useful galaxy apps Network reception Call quality Compact size.  Cons. Battery backup Heating issue Huge price drop after 1 year.  Flipkart mobile exchange is very smooth, and they have given the best deal. I exchanged my oneplus with Rs 14000 and got a bank discount Rs. 8000 and prepaid offer got discount of Rs. 5000.

I am not a heavy user and don't play games on small screen due to which i get excellent battery backup. I charge only once in a day and that too not 100%. Still i get entire day backp.  3. S23 series also got Samsung AI features so not much missing on anything which is there in S24 series.  S23 has Snapdragon 8 gen 2 processor compared to S24 and S24 plus. They have Exynos proc which is decent but not the best.  Very happy with this purchase. I will recommend this device at the price point which i got. It is best deal anyone can get.  Hope this review helps.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: I have been using this mobile for a while now. Here's my honest review based on my experience.  Battery Performance: The battery life on this mobile is quite impressive under moderate usage. It easily lasts a full day. However, I noticed that when using the 5G network, the battery drains heavily. This is common for all phones not a Samsung issue.  Design and Build: The slim design of the mobile is a major plus point. It fells comfortable to hold and is suitable for single hand usage. However, I noticed that the paint on aluminium frame is starting to wear off, which is disappointing. It's something that Samsung should address for better durability.  Camera: The camera, especially when using the portrait mode, captures good images with nice depth of field. However, I did notice a lack of clarity when zooming in on subjects.  Expert Raw Option: For photography enthusiasts or professionals, the expert RAW option is a standout feature. It provides more control and flexibility over the image settings, allowing for advanced editing and post- processing.  I hope this review helps you make an informed decision. Happy shopping!\n",
      "Rating: 3, Review: Product is good Cons: While using cam heating issue Battery back up less When we bought with 70K they should provide case and charming adoptor, but no case no charging adopotor  Pros: processor, cam, display, design, looks premium.  Note: When I try to sign in some other 2 numbers also coming that means it is used one. Where ever mobile number is required it is showing 2 other numbers which is not mine. Also I have seen a very minor scratch at the top of phone. Flipkart simply cheated customers.  So buyers, When you are buying expensive phones be careful and buy offline. My best suggestion.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Iam sharing my experience after 12 days of excessive use Display is top notch you can feel how premium it is. Performance is on the another level I don't game lot and afterall it isn't a gaming device.it doesn't compromise And the main thing everyone is complaining about is the battery. So in my experience many of those guys doesn't used any flagship device before. This phone is compact and everything is packed in right here. Right now i use my device in max settings nothing is turned off.even though it has a smaller battery i do get 6hr of screen on time at the end of the day and 27%charge remains Which is great. And my device doesn't heat that much till now,but it gets warm when it is charging which is so obvious. After it is all aluminum so it do feel warm Till now everything is good....\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Pros 1)CAMERA- 5 out of 5. The ultrawide camera can get a little work done because in some environment photos seems a little dark then main camera. 2)DISPLAY- 5 OUT 5. The display is stunning and that 120hz is criminally smooth. 3)BATTERY- 4.5 out of 5. 3900mah feels good Enough for me .But a little bit more mah and it would me much appreciated. 4)SOUND- 4 OUT OF 5. With dolby atmos stereo speakers sounds great. But the bass seems a little low than its bigger sibling s23+. 5)STORAGE AND RAM- 5 OUT 5. 256gb variant is good enough for me and also because this variant comes with ufs 4.0 the overall experience is way better. And with 8gb ram everday task is just seamless with this much ram i have stopped the habit of removing apps from recent you can just use a app and then press home button and then go of with your day and when you want you can retrieve the same app from where you left on next day and also with ram you extend it upto 16gb. 6)PERFORMANCE- 5 OUT 5 . SNAPDRAGON 8 GEN 2 performs great. And i dont think i have to tell how good day to day task performs. So i will go on heavy task the only heavy task i do is playing genshin and yeah it you can play it on high settings at 30 fps yeah it does get a little bit of frame drops and hitches but overall it performs good if you play it on mid settings it goes pretty well the only problem what gets in way is battery backup but it also gets solves if you play it on low settings and if you do that you can get a play time of almost 3 hours on full charge easy.\n",

Gameplay(bgmi/genshin) great. Wont lag much, might see some frame drops in bgmi customs otherwise no. Look and feel is very premium especially for the green color. Compared to apple 120 refresh rate is great. We have telephoto zoom. Comparable battery life. No lags while using the phone.  Cons: UI can use some improvements. Picture and picture mode can be improved. Can give 90 hz feature also (force or adaptive). Battery is good, but it can get better.  Will update if i find some more pros and cons.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: Very good phone but pricing is a bit higher. Battery backup is above average but samsung needs to improve changing technology. 15w charger takes almost 90 minutes but 25w also takes 75-80 min from 0-100. Camera is awesome. RAM Management is fabulous. Heating issue after some heavy tasks and even after using 10 min of camera app. Samsung needs to fix it with software update.\n",

Update to the latest software 2. Use dark mode and if possible a black wallpaper ( as its amoled the blacks will reduce battery consumption) 3. Battery protection - on 4. Battery saving - on 5. Performance profile - normal (More than enough for daily use) - while gaming the setting automatocally changes to max performance 6. Screen can be turned to 60hz (optional)  No other android os is giving so much customization to control the hardware part of your phone - feels good  My observations after using it for 2 weeks  In hand feel is awesome feels like iphone of android world  Display is flagship level except for thick bezel - trust me u will forget the bezels after few days  Sofware - one of the best OS. I have used more than 8 phones including iphone in past 10 years and one ui stands high (my 1st samsung phone)  Camera is superb in day light but if you zoom in details will fade a bit, in comparision to iphone its low but in comparision with other phone its better  Processor is more than enough for daily tasks, yes its gets warm but it is coz of the processor, materials used in the build of the phone (it can be minimized to great extent if you do few suggested settings in the phone)  Battery drain is there but again can be minimised to a great extent - suggested settings  Overall a nice phone with camera, display, design and software feeling gives feeling of a flagship and processor and battery of a midranger at a price of a midranger - @ 28k it stands out for its name S23 FE\n",

Small small features enhances the experience like galaxy AI, Aod, etc. However battery and warming issue tends to be one of the problems which needs to be considered before buying the product. If you're someone who uses the phone alot throughout the day, than you will need to charge your phone twice a day. The thing which also needs to be considered before buying is that it is kind of heavy weighted. Overall experience is top notch. The product has premium feel. Camera quality is amzing.

      "Rating: 5, Review: Upgraded from Samsung M21 to this, and kept feeling amazed during the entire migration process (Samsung has really refined the Smart Switch utility to the extent that the new phone is an exact replica of the old one).  The phone is a bit on the heavier side but mainly due to the metal parts and battery. It feels top notch premium, and performs buttery smooth (Note: it's slippery as it has glass on both sides so it's a good idea to have a case ready for it when it comes).  The camera is stellar, and both the photos and videos are exceptional. The screen is crisp and smooth, and feels very responsive. The battery life may need more testing, can't say much.  Overall a superb deal at 38k (for the 256GB model).\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: 1. Looks and design It looks very good for the designer look of this phone but the bezel of this phone is a bit bigger compared to other Samsung phones. 2. Display Watching videos and movies looks great thanks to the Amoled 2X display. 3. Processor The Exynos 2200 processor makes the phone a bit more of a hit. 4. Camera The phone's rear camera is 50mp + 12mp + 8mp, front camera is 10mp, along with OIS, the photo and video quality is very good. 5. Battery Even though it's 4500mAh, the screen on time lasts 10 hours with normal usage. If you use more, you have to recharge it twice a day, but this phone supports only 25W adapter.  # It would be great if the adapter of this phone was 45 watts instead of 25 watts. # It would be better if the bezel of this phone is a little less. # Battery backup of this phone would have been better.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Before BBD 2024 no. Of ratings were 15000+, as on 7/10/24 the no. Of reveiws has crossed 32000+  Suggeted settings to reduce heating and battery drain issue  1. Update to the latest software 2. Use dark mode and if possible a black wallpaper ( as its amoled the blacks will reduce battery consumption) 3. Battery protection - on 4. Battery saving - on 5. Performance profile - normal (More than enough for daily use) - while gaming the setting automatocally changes to max performance 6. Screen can be turned to 60hz (optional)  No other android os is giving so much customization to control the hardware part of your phone - feels good  My observations after using it for 2 weeks  In hand feel is awesome feels like iphone of android world  Display is flagship level except for thick bezel - trust me u will forget the bezels after few days  Sofware - one of the best OS. I have used more than 8 phones including iphone in past 10 years and one ui stands high (my 1st samsung phone)  Camera is superb in day light but if you zoom in details will fade a bit, in comparision to iphone its low but in comparision with other phone its better  Processor is more than enough for daily tasks, yes its gets warm but it is coz of the processor, materials used in the build of the phone (it can be minimized to great extent if you do few suggested settings in the phone)  Battery drain is there but again can be minimised to a great extent - suggested settings  Overall a nice phone with camera, display, design and software feeling gives feeling of a flagship and processor and battery of a midranger at a price of a midranger - @ 28k it stands out for its name S23 FE\n",

Small small features enhances the experience like galaxy AI, Aod, etc. However battery and warming issue tends to be one of the problems which needs to be considered before buying the product. If you're someone who uses the phone alot throughout the day, than you will need to charge your phone twice a day. The thing which also needs to be considered before buying is that it is kind of heavy weighted. Overall experience is top notch. The product has premium feel. Camera quality is amzing. The back side gives premium look to the device. Even thogh processor is exynos , the phone was running very much smoothly only issue was warming if we don't consider that it has that premium feel processor.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Upgraded from Samsung M21 to this, and kept feeling amazed during the entire migration process (Samsung has really refined the Smart Switch utility to the extent that the new phone is an exact replica of the old one).  The phone is a bit on the heavier side but mainly due to the metal parts and battery. It feels top notch premium, and performs buttery smooth (Note: it's slippery as it has glass on both sides so it's a good idea to have a case ready for it when it comes).  The camera is stellar, and both the photos and videos are exceptional. The screen is crisp and smooth, and feels very responsive. The battery life may need more testing, can't say much.  Overall a superb deal at 38k (for the 256GB model).\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Before BBD 2024 no. Of ratings were 15000+, as on 7/10/24 the no. Of reveiws has crossed 32000+  Suggeted settings to reduce heating and battery drain issue  1. Update to the latest software 2. Use dark mode and if possible a black wallpaper ( as its amoled the blacks will reduce battery consumption) 3. Battery protection - on 4. Battery saving - on 5. Performance profile - normal (More than enough for daily use) - while gaming the setting automatocally changes to max performance 6. Screen can be turned to 60hz (optional)  No other android os is giving so much customization to control the hardware part of your phone - feels good  My observations after using it for 2 weeks  In hand feel is awesome feels like iphone of android world  Display is flagship level except for thick bezel - trust me u will forget the bezels after few days  Sofware - one of the best OS. I have used more than 8 phones including iphone in past 10 years and one ui stands high (my 1st samsung phone)  Camera is superb in day light but if you zoom in details will fade a bit, in comparision to iphone its low but in comparision with other phone its better  Processor is more than enough for daily tasks, yes its gets warm but it is coz of the processor, materials used in the build of the phone (it can be minimized to great extent if you do few suggested settings in the phone)  Battery drain is there but again can be minimised to a great extent - suggested settings  Overall a nice phone with camera, display, design and software feeling gives feeling of a flagship and processor and battery of a midranger at a price of a midranger - @ 28k it stands out for its name S23 FE\n",

Small small features enhances the experience like galaxy AI, Aod, etc. However battery and warming issue tends to be one of the problems which needs to be considered before buying the product. If you're someone who uses the phone alot throughout the day, than you will need to charge your phone twice a day. The thing which also needs to be considered before buying is that it is kind of heavy weighted. Overall experience is top notch. The product has premium feel. Camera quality is amzing. The back side gives premium look to the device. Even thogh processor is exynos , the phone was running very much smoothly only issue was warming if we don't consider that it has that premium feel processor.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Upgraded from Samsung M21 to this, and kept feeling amazed during the entire migration process (Samsung has really refined the Smart Switch utility to the extent that the new phone is an exact replica of the old one).  The phone is a bit on the heavier side but mainly due to the metal parts and battery. It feels top notch premium, and performs buttery smooth (Note: it's slippery as it has glass on both sides so it's a good idea to have a case ready for it when it comes).  The camera is stellar, and both the photos and videos are exceptional. The screen is crisp and smooth, and feels very responsive. The battery life may need more testing, can't say much.  Overall a superb deal at 38k (for the 256GB model).\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Before BBD 2024 no. Of ratings were 15000+, as on 7/10/24 the no. Of reveiws has crossed 32000+  Suggeted settings to reduce heating and battery drain issue  1. Update to the latest software 2. Use dark mode and if possible a black wallpaper ( as its amoled the blacks will reduce battery consumption) 3. Battery protection - on 4. Battery saving - on 5. Performance profile - normal (More than enough for daily use) - while gaming the setting automatocally changes to max performance 6. Screen can be turned to 60hz (optional)  No other android os is giving so much customization to control the hardware part of your phone - feels good  My observations after using it for 2 weeks  In hand feel is awesome feels like iphone of android world  Display is flagship level except for thick bezel - trust me u will forget the bezels after few days  Sofware - one of the best OS. I have used more than 8 phones including iphone in past 10 years and one ui stands high (my 1st samsung phone)  Camera is superb in day light but if you zoom in details will fade a bit, in comparision to iphone its low but in comparision with other phone its better  Processor is more than enough for daily tasks, yes its gets warm but it is coz of the processor, materials used in the build of the phone (it can be minimized to great extent if you do few suggested settings in the phone)  Battery drain is there but again can be minimised to a great extent - suggested settings  Overall a nice phone with camera, display, design and software feeling gives feeling of a flagship and processor and battery of a midranger at a price of a midranger - @ 28k it stands out for its name S23 FE\n",

      "Rating: 4, Review: 23 FE has amazing display and smoothness for day to day task which is not heavy. Small small features enhances the experience like galaxy AI, Aod, etc. However battery and warming issue tends to be one of the problems which needs to be considered before buying the product. If you're someone who uses the phone alot throughout the day, than you will need to charge your phone twice a day. The thing which also needs to be considered before buying is that it is kind of heavy weighted. Overall experience is top notch. The product has premium feel. Camera quality is amzing. The back side gives premium look to the device. Even thogh processor is exynos , the phone was running very much smoothly only issue was warming if we don't consider that it has that premium feel processor.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Upgraded from Samsung M21 to this, and kept feeling amazed during the entire migration process (Samsung has really refined the Smart Switch utility to the extent that the new phone is an exact replica of the old one).  The phone is a bit on the heavier side but mainly due to the metal parts and battery. It feels top notch premium, and performs buttery smooth (Note: it's slippery as it has glass on both sides so it's a good idea to have a case ready for it when it comes).  The camera is stellar, and both the photos and videos are exceptional. The screen is crisp and smooth, and feels very responsive. The battery life may need more testing, can't say much.  Overall a superb deal at 38k (for the 256GB model).\n",

Display Watching videos and movies looks great thanks to the Amoled 2X display. 3. Processor The Exynos 2200 processor makes the phone a bit more of a hit. 4. Camera The phone's rear camera is 50mp + 12mp + 8mp, front camera is 10mp, along with OIS, the photo and video quality is very good. 5. Battery Even though it's 4500mAh, the screen on time lasts 10 hours with normal usage. If you use more, you have to recharge it twice a day, but this phone supports only 25W adapter.  # It would be great if the adapter of this phone was 45 watts instead of 25 watts. # It would be better if the bezel of this phone is a little less. # Battery backup of this phone would have been better.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: This is the best Android device available to those who don't like big phones but want everything that a big phone can do.  Everything is super smooth here.  Great camera quality and great video recording capabilities thanks to super stabilised video.  Battery is great too if you don't Play too much heavy games then it will last whole day.  Display is the best in the segment super bright and punchy, colours are just awesome ofcourse it is a Samsung display.  Man the processor.... What a great processor built by Qualcomm. Super powerful and battery efficient. You can throw any task it doesn't matter.  Everything is good you can go for it only the price a little higher side... If that is not your concern you can just blindly go for it.\n",

Gives it a smooth user experience.  Cons: 1. While gaming, it alot, i guess no cooling features in it. 2. Battery drain 1 % in every 2 minutes while gaming. 3. Mic quality need to be improved, there is sparkle voice of other person while on speakers 4. No charger, no back cover, i think when we buy expensive phone, we deserve both of them.. 5. rest things just fine, will add on review if get anything else..\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Received this beauty on 27 Feb 2023 and hands down to the performance of the phone. This is my first Samsung phone and I am very impressed. The images are spot on, stable videos and can shoot in 8k is a big plus for me. As the gen 2 is very power efficient my phone with moderate usage easily last around a day which is very impressive by a compact smart phone. Cream color is like a treat to watch. Just close your eyes and grab this amazing product by Samsung.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Great phone, lovely weight balance. The in hand feel is amazing it's so lite that I barely feel it in my pocket. The images from the camera are decent too in every lighting condition. I have attached some samples with this review. I'm very satisfied with the phone. I do get around 5-6 hour of SOT which is pretty good for a phone of this size. The screen is bright and vibrant which is expected from a Samsung. I would definitely recommend if you are looking for a tiny and complete phone with all the bells and whistles.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Don't panic, for couple of days battery will drain very fast and phone would be heating a lot. Once updated to latest software version above issues would get resolved. PROS: compact handy phone, call quality excellent, internet connectivity stable and fast, camera excellent, AI features, Samsung proprietary features like Galaxy watch, wallet, store, Knox support CONS: battery will last a day on average to medium use, no charger provided in the box charging time almost 90 min for 3900 mAH battery, for couple of days it tends to fall down due to compact size and weight as compared to regular 6.7 inch phones. VERDICT: at 43K for 256GB variant it's worth to have a flagship phone from Samsung.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: great picture quality just wow... powerful performance ....only heting problem\n",
      "Rating: 4, Review: Writing brutally honest review  I have been using this beast for the last 2 weeks so I have pretty much experienced everything.  I wanted a compact phone for work purposes and my usage includes 30+ calls in a day , 8-10 emails , opening 2-3 sheets as and when required. While I was searching for a compact and powerful device almost everyone suggested that I go for an iPhone 13/14. But since I've used apple I was more inclined towards Android and there're hardly any options available in Android when it comes to compact size.  Coming back to my experience.  Battery -This phone gives me excellent battery back-up. I charge it in the morning around 9.30 am which continues till next day noon around 2-3pm which is fantabulous.  Camera - used it very less though but clicked some images and compared it with the OnePlus 10 pro and iphone 14 , trust me both have failed in front of this small beast.  Heating - never faced any heating issues till now even during long calls.  I think the above 3 are major parameters on which people decide their purchase.  Bottom line - if you have a budget then go for it. You won't regret it.\n",

      "Rating: 4, Review: EDIT: Review after 17 months usage There are hundreds of reviews for this device so let me get straight to the pros and cons as a normal user. Cons: 1. Battery life is not as great as many reviewers say, I'm not a heavy user but if I'm traveling and using phone data the device doesn't even last a day. A hard reset did help improving the battery performance but still it hardly lasts a day. 2. Samsung is providing 45W charging speed for the Plus and Ultra models but only 25W for S23, this is disappointing considering the phone is expensive. 3. Screen is usable in sunlight but it is not as bright as competition.  Pros 1. The camera, is hands down one the best in the market. See with still photos many Android phone makers are doing a great job even at half the price of S23 so I won't say that it is worth the price for stills but in videos, it absolutely shines and the results are worth every penny. 2. Performance is just great, SD 8gen 2 is great while shooting long timelapse, editing videos, and playing games...it does get warm but it is normal. I'm glad Samsung skipped Exynos for S23. 3. Design-wise the phone is pretty simple and geometrical with no gimmicks. Its size is perfect for one-hand use. Also, I love the new standardized look Samsung is going with all of its phones. 4. The flagship experience is best with Samsung. A 4-year software update means you get to enjoy the device for a long-long time. 5. Samsung's ecosystem is getting really good, if you're using more Samsung devices and Windows PC then you get something closer to Apple's Ecosystem. Phone-Link app works perfectly to transfer images, manage calls and even use phone as a webcam. 6. With One UI 6.1 the software experience has become even better. The phone feels way more polished now.  At current market price S23 is highly recommended.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: I've used it for a month now and I can say one thing for sure, This is the best phone I've used till now. I've got it for 40k after offers and exchange and I've never had a regret once. Ultra may have more advanced features, but me as a fan of handy phones, S23 feels right for me.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: The phone is awesome,I got this by 52k.But it is worth the price. Display is awesome Indisplay finger print is very much responsive Battery backup is ok for one day use Camera performance is top notch Portrait mode is like Dslr cameras Night mode is also good Videography is good Good refresh rate One hand phone Only drawbacks are no charger inside the box we have to purchase separately Charging speed is more than 1 hour to full charge.\n",
      "Rating: 4, Review: I got this product at 38k in big billon 128gb variant. At this price i will say i got best smartphone.  Probs 1) excellent design. 2) light weight pocket frendly device. 3) good camera 4) performance is really excellent.  Cons- 1) videography in night not gets good results. 2) little bit heating issue there if you use this device without case. But highlighting that heating issue does not affect to its performance. Thinking it is compact phone small heating problem is ignorable.    Average point 1) battery backup - you will get around 6 hrs battery backup. Now according to you you think is it sufficient to you or not but inwould say as a compact phone this is the best battery backup. If you use power 🔋 saving mode then trust me it is providing such a best results . (Performance will be down)     Charging time take around 1 hr using 25w original adapter. This was a review from my side. Thank you\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: The best small size phone (6.1 inch display) I have used.  It's a Samsung flagship and they have got almost everything right - Fantastic cameras, Awesome AI, Amazing and Premium Display, Design, Size, Smooth and Excellent to use and to a good extent, even for high resource usage tasks. Battery consumption is also very well optimised and charges at a good speed.  The only minor improvement per me could be, a slightly higher capacity battery and faster charging.  Highly recommended S23, if you prefer a smaller and compact phone. With deals and offers, if you are able to get this for less than 45k, it's really worth.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: I upgraded to this from Redmi Note 4, so it is a very significant upgrade for me. Phone is fast, super responsive with no lag at all which is what you expect from a Snapdragon 8 gen 2 for Galaxy. I got 256 GB variant, so I have UFS 4.0 storage. Best camera and display, design wise looks awesome with thin and even bezels. Phone is a bit small which is perfect for my small palm but that means battery is also small and gives around 6 hours of screen on time. If you are just watching downloaded videos, you can get 9-10 hours of screen on time. One UI is awesome, just waiting for 6.1 to try out the AI for Galaxy. Overall a well balanced and powerful phone.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Overall very good phone. if you use your mobile extensively then battery MAY disappoint you. For me battery is enough to survive whole day.  Camera is good. it will take pictures close to reality. if you are relame/poco/oppo and other Chinese phone user and planning to switch to samsung then be mindful that camera selfi will take your real photo and will not apply lipstick and makeup and you may end up hating you own face.  In performance department as well it is excellent.  while charging phone get worm which is expected.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: This is really compact monster 😍 everytime feels excited to holding this phone in hand. Don't bother about battery life, it gives easily more than 1 day and there are wok around to improve the battery life - manage the performance profile switching from standard to light, and select 60hrtz refresh rate, and I am not a gamer, and hence for daily usage battery is sufficient, Samsung provides 4 years security and OS updates, camera clarity is very good, audio- cristal clear, oueUI is awesome, i was using Samsung M51 before, was sceptical between iPhone 14 as price is almost same, but iPhone is just show off, and only brand. Just go for it if you have budget, and don't bother on negative reviews.\n",

Processor, display, camera all are outstanding. So decision is yours, if you can sacrifise little bit on battery then go for it without a second thought.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: Writing this review after using for 6 months Pros: Camera quality is impressive especially Portait mode.. The quality of images are similar to DSLR camera. Phone is smooth and it works like a magic. Cons: As this is compact phone.. typing something needs more care.. lot of typi mistakes by using tge small keyboard. Fingerprint doesn't work sometimes.Had to to try multiple times. Battery drains faster..always need to carry backup or charger with you.\n",

And Lastly,both of the UI's are great .\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: Pros- 1. Battery is surprisingly good for a compact form factor. 2. OneUI is so well polished for this S23. And excellent software update support. 3. Camera is one of the best in the industry. 4. Snapdragon 8 Gen2 is a beast. Powerful as well as efficient.  Cons- 1. Can get warm sometime. 2. Charging speed is slow at 25W, should have been 45W instead.  Verdict- Best is class (Compact True Flagship)\n",
      "Rating: 4, Review: After almost 15 days of usage, Samsung S23 has lived up to my expectations. The obvious pros are its compact form factor and splendid display. During the initial few days of usage, the phone does get warm along the metal frame while multitasking or using heavy apps, but that has settled down now with continuous optimization. It still gets slightly warm but nothing too alarming. One suggestion for those users who take a lot of pictures or videos is that the 128 GB may seem to be a little short in storage. The AI based stuff already consumes quite a bit of space with regular software updates.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Mobile is fantastic. the best feature is its size. The camera works well, and UI experience is also good. The only concern is its battery and heating issue, I have been using this mobile for 1 week, and the heating issue always persists. We can get the battery until 8 pm. in moderate usage. I am never playing games on mobile. Display is top notch even better than the iPhone 14 pro. S23 Phone is better in so many segments compared to iPhone 14 pro. It never hangs, even if we use so many applications at a time. UI is 💯. Screenshot, call recorder,screen recorder, and 30X Zoom we will not get in iPhone 14 pro. Pros of mobile Display UI Lots of useful galaxy apps Network reception Call quality Compact size.  Cons. Battery backup Heating issue Huge price drop after 1 year.  Flipkart mobile exchange is very smooth, and they have given the best deal. I exchanged my oneplus with Rs 14000 and got a bank discount Rs. 8000 and prepaid offer got discount of Rs. 5000.

I am not a heavy user and don't play games on small screen due to which i get excellent battery backup. I charge only once in a day and that too not 100%. Still i get entire day backp.  3. S23 series also got Samsung AI features so not much missing on anything which is there in S24 series.  S23 has Snapdragon 8 gen 2 processor compared to S24 and S24 plus. They have Exynos proc which is decent but not the best.  Very happy with this purchase. I will recommend this device at the price point which i got. It is best deal anyone can get.  Hope this review helps.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: I have been using this mobile for a while now. Here's my honest review based on my experience.  Battery Performance: The battery life on this mobile is quite impressive under moderate usage. It easily lasts a full day. However, I noticed that when using the 5G network, the battery drains heavily. This is common for all phones not a Samsung issue.  Design and Build: The slim design of the mobile is a major plus point. It fells comfortable to hold and is suitable for single hand usage. However, I noticed that the paint on aluminium frame is starting to wear off, which is disappointing. It's something that Samsung should address for better durability.  Camera: The camera, especially when using the portrait mode, captures good images with nice depth of field. However, I did notice a lack of clarity when zooming in on subjects.  Expert Raw Option: For photography enthusiasts or professionals, the expert RAW option is a standout feature. It provides more control and flexibility over the image settings, allowing for advanced editing and post- processing.  I hope this review helps you make an informed decision. Happy shopping!\n",
      "Rating: 3, Review: Product is good Cons: While using cam heating issue Battery back up less When we bought with 70K they should provide case and charming adoptor, but no case no charging adopotor  Pros: processor, cam, display, design, looks premium.  Note: When I try to sign in some other 2 numbers also coming that means it is used one. Where ever mobile number is required it is showing 2 other numbers which is not mine. Also I have seen a very minor scratch at the top of phone. Flipkart simply cheated customers.  So buyers, When you are buying expensive phones be careful and buy offline. My best suggestion.\n",

So in my experience many of those guys doesn't used any flagship device before. This phone is compact and everything is packed in right here. Right now i use my device in max settings nothing is turned off.even though it has a smaller battery i do get 6hr of screen on time at the end of the day and 27%charge remains Which is great. And my device doesn't heat that much till now,but it gets warm when it is charging which is so obvious. After it is all aluminum so it do feel warm Till now everything is good....\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: It's a great phone to buy if u are looking for compact phone, but dont do the same mistake as I did . buy a thin slim case to enjoy the phones slim bezels . I bought a armored case and now besels looks thick\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: Pros 1)CAMERA- 5 out of 5. The ultrawide camera can get a little work done because in some environment photos seems a little dark then main camera. 2)DISPLAY- 5 OUT 5. The display is stunning and that 120hz is criminally smooth. 3)BATTERY- 4.5 out of 5. 3900mah feels good Enough for me .But a little bit more mah and it would me much appreciated. 4)SOUND- 4 OUT OF 5. With dolby atmos stereo speakers sounds great. But the bass seems a little low than its bigger sibling s23+. 5)STORAGE AND RAM- 5 OUT 5. 256gb variant is good enough for me and also because this variant comes with ufs 4.0 the overall experience is way better. And with 8gb ram everday task is just seamless with this much ram i have stopped the habit of removing apps from recent you can just use a app and then press home button and then go of with your day and when you want you can retrieve the same app from where you left on next day and also with ram you extend it upto 16gb. 6)PERFORMANCE- 5 OUT 5 . SNAPDRAGON 8 GEN 2 performs great. And i dont think i have to tell how good day to day task performs. So i will go on heavy task the only heavy task i do is playing genshin and yeah it you can play it on high settings at 30 fps yeah it does get a little bit of frame drops and hitches but overall it performs good if you play it on mid settings it goes pretty well the only problem what gets in way is battery backup but it also gets solves if you play it on low settings and if you do that you can get a play time of almost 3 hours on full charge easy.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Switch from Pixel 7,before that from iPhone 13. My decision of switching was 💯 % correct.If samsung ditched SD chipset in smaller S series than that will be a huge bummer 😔. So far so good but SD chipset in S23 is the original matchmaker.I don't know about Exynos, let's see in coming years. Samsung update policy will keep it afresh I guess !\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Long term review, moving from apple to samsung  Battery is great for normal usage. For gamers or heavy usage, its good but wont last whole day probably. Camera is good. Gameplay(bgmi/genshin) great. Wont lag much, might see some frame drops in bgmi customs otherwise no. Look and feel is very premium especially for the green color. Compared to apple 120 refresh rate is great. We have telephoto zoom. Comparable battery life. No lags while using the phone.  Cons: UI can use some improvements. Picture and picture mode can be improved. Can give 90 hz feature also (force or adaptive). Battery is good, but it can get better.  Will update if i find some more pros and cons.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: Very good phone but pricing is a bit higher. Battery backup is above average but samsung needs to improve changing technology. 15w charger takes almost 90 minutes but 25w also takes 75-80 min from 0-100. Camera is awesome. RAM Management is fabulous. Heating issue after some heavy tasks and even after using 10 min of camera app. Samsung needs to fix it with software update.\n",

I tried everything including software update,changing the network closing background tabs etc. I mean i will be okay if the heating issue is happening while gaming but it gets hot just for using social media and that is a problem. A big drawback since it has one of the best processor i didn't expect this. And it has some glitches while using some apps. I mean for a 50k phone this is not something that i signed up for. Disappointed with the purchase.\n",

Phone gets heated on medium usage (excluding gaming), but still manageable.\n",

I'm fully satisfied with it, especially the night photography. 📸✨ However, there's a heating issue that I think is due to the Exynos processor.

      "Rating: 5, Review: Before BBD 2024 no. Of ratings were 15000+, as on 7/10/24 the no. Of reveiws has crossed 32000+  Suggeted settings to reduce heating and battery drain issue  1. Update to the latest software 2. Use dark mode and if possible a black wallpaper ( as its amoled the blacks will reduce battery consumption) 3. Battery protection - on 4. Battery saving - on 5. Performance profile - normal (More than enough for daily use) - while gaming the setting automatocally changes to max performance 6. Screen can be turned to 60hz (optional)  No other android os is giving so much customization to control the hardware part of your phone - feels good  My observations after using it for 2 weeks  In hand feel is awesome feels like iphone of android world  Display is flagship level except for thick bezel - trust me u will forget the bezels after few days  Sofware - one of the best OS. I have used more than 8 phones including iphone in past 10 years and one ui stands high (my 1st samsung phone)  Camera is superb in day light but if you zoom in details will fade a bit, in comparision to iphone its low but in comparision with other phone its better  Processor is more than enough for daily tasks, yes its gets warm but it is coz of the processor, materials used in the build of the phone (it can be minimized to great extent if you do few suggested settings in the phone)  Battery drain is there but again can be minimised to a great extent - suggested settings  Overall a nice phone with camera, display, design and software feeling gives feeling of a flagship and processor and battery of a midranger at a price of a midranger - @ 28k it stands out for its name S23 FE\n",

Small small features enhances the experience like galaxy AI, Aod, etc. However battery and warming issue tends to be one of the problems which needs to be considered before buying the product. If you're someone who uses the phone alot throughout the day, than you will need to charge your phone twice a day. The thing which also needs to be considered before buying is that it is kind of heavy weighted. Overall experience is top notch. The product has premium feel. Camera quality is amzing. The back side gives premium look to the device.

      "Rating: 5, Review: Upgraded from Samsung M21 to this, and kept feeling amazed during the entire migration process (Samsung has really refined the Smart Switch utility to the extent that the new phone is an exact replica of the old one).  The phone is a bit on the heavier side but mainly due to the metal parts and battery. It feels top notch premium, and performs buttery smooth (Note: it's slippery as it has glass on both sides so it's a good idea to have a case ready for it when it comes).  The camera is stellar, and both the photos and videos are exceptional. The screen is crisp and smooth, and feels very responsive. The battery life may need more testing, can't say much.  Overall a superb deal at 38k (for the 256GB model).\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: 1. Looks and design It looks very good for the designer look of this phone but the bezel of this phone is a bit bigger compared to other Samsung phones. 2. Display Watching videos and movies looks great thanks to the Amoled 2X display. 3. Processor The Exynos 2200 processor makes the phone a bit more of a hit. 4. Camera The phone's rear camera is 50mp + 12mp + 8mp, front camera is 10mp, along with OIS, the photo and video quality is very good. 5. Battery Even though it's 4500mAh, the screen on time lasts 10 hours with normal usage. If you use more, you have to recharge it twice a day, but this phone supports only 25W adapter.  # It would be great if the adapter of this phone was 45 watts instead of 25 watts. # It would be better if the bezel of this phone is a little less. # Battery backup of this phone would have been better.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Before BBD 2024 no. Of ratings were 15000+, as on 7/10/24 the no. Of reveiws has crossed 32000+  Suggeted settings to reduce heating and battery drain issue  1. Update to the latest software 2. Use dark mode and if possible a black wallpaper ( as its amoled the blacks will reduce battery consumption) 3. Battery protection - on 4. Battery saving - on 5. Performance profile - normal (More than enough for daily use) - while gaming the setting automatocally changes to max performance 6. Screen can be turned to 60hz (optional)  No other android os is giving so much customization to control the hardware part of your phone - feels good  My observations after using it for 2 weeks  In hand feel is awesome feels like iphone of android world  Display is flagship level except for thick bezel - trust me u will forget the bezels after few days  Sofware - one of the best OS. I have used more than 8 phones including iphone in past 10 years and one ui stands high (my 1st samsung phone)  Camera is superb in day light but if you zoom in details will fade a bit, in comparision to iphone its low but in comparision with other phone its better  Processor is more than enough for daily tasks, yes its gets warm but it is coz of the processor, materials used in the build of the phone (it can be minimized to great extent if you do few suggested settings in the phone)  Battery drain is there but again can be minimised to a great extent - suggested settings  Overall a nice phone with camera, display, design and software feeling gives feeling of a flagship and processor and battery of a midranger at a price of a midranger - @ 28k it stands out for its name S23 FE\n",

Small small features enhances the experience like galaxy AI, Aod, etc. However battery and warming issue tends to be one of the problems which needs to be considered before buying the product. If you're someone who uses the phone alot throughout the day, than you will need to charge your phone twice a day. The thing which also needs to be considered before buying is that it is kind of heavy weighted. Overall experience is top notch. The product has premium feel. Camera quality is amzing. The back side gives premium look to the device. Even thogh processor is exynos , the phone was running very much smoothly only issue was warming if we don't consider that it has that premium feel processor.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Upgraded from Samsung M21 to this, and kept feeling amazed during the entire migration process (Samsung has really refined the Smart Switch utility to the extent that the new phone is an exact replica of the old one).  The phone is a bit on the heavier side but mainly due to the metal parts and battery. It feels top notch premium, and performs buttery smooth (Note: it's slippery as it has glass on both sides so it's a good idea to have a case ready for it when it comes).  The camera is stellar, and both the photos and videos are exceptional. The screen is crisp and smooth, and feels very responsive. The battery life may need more testing, can't say much.  Overall a superb deal at 38k (for the 256GB model).\n",

My previous phone Samsung A12 is performing much better even after 3 years of continuous rough use.  Not to Forget, It gets heated up so much you can literally cook something it feels.  Very bad experience. Regretting my decision of buying it. Others might be obsessing over it's camera, AI etc. but still the basic things remains not as per expected.  Really Disappointed\n",

Had m51 previously which easily lasted for 2 days on medium usage even after 3 years. This one is a very step down from that. 2. Phone gets heated on medium usage (excluding gaming), but still manageable.\n",

Great camera quality and great video recording capabilities thanks to super stabilised video.  Battery is great too if you don't Play too much heavy games then it will last whole day.  Display is the best in the segment super bright and punchy, colours are just awesome ofcourse it is a Samsung display.  Man the processor.... What a great processor built by Qualcomm. Super powerful and battery efficient. You can throw any task it doesn't matter.  Everything is good you can go for it only the price a little higher side...

The images are spot on, stable videos and can shoot in 8k is a big plus for me. As the gen 2 is very power efficient my phone with moderate usage easily last around a day which is very impressive by a compact smart phone. Cream color is like a treat to watch. Just close your eyes and grab this amazing product by Samsung.\n",

The images from the camera are decent too in every lighting condition. I have attached some samples with this review. I'm very satisfied with the phone. I do get around 5-6 hour of SOT which is pretty good for a phone of this size. The screen is bright and vibrant which is expected from a Samsung. I would definitely recommend if you are looking for a tiny and complete phone with all the bells and whistles.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Don't panic, for couple of days battery will drain very fast and phone would be heating a lot. Once updated to latest software version above issues would get resolved. PROS: compact handy phone, call quality excellent, internet connectivity stable and fast, camera excellent, AI features, Samsung proprietary features like Galaxy watch, wallet, store, Knox support CONS: battery will last a day on average to medium use, no charger provided in the box charging time almost 90 min for 3900 mAH battery, for couple of days it tends to fall down due to compact size and weight as compared to regular 6.7 inch phones. VERDICT: at 43K for 256GB variant it's worth to have a flagship phone from Samsung.\n",

      "Rating: 4, Review: Writing brutally honest review  I have been using this beast for the last 2 weeks so I have pretty much experienced everything.  I wanted a compact phone for work purposes and my usage includes 30+ calls in a day , 8-10 emails , opening 2-3 sheets as and when required. While I was searching for a compact and powerful device almost everyone suggested that I go for an iPhone 13/14. But since I've used apple I was more inclined towards Android and there're hardly any options available in Android when it comes to compact size.  Coming back to my experience.  Battery -This phone gives me excellent battery back-up. I charge it in the morning around 9.30 am which continues till next day noon around 2-3pm which is fantabulous.  Camera - used it very less though but clicked some images and compared it with the OnePlus 10 pro and iphone 14 , trust me both have failed in front of this small beast.  Heating - never faced any heating issues till now even during long calls.  I think the above 3 are major parameters on which people decide their purchase.  Bottom line - if you have a budget then go for it. You won't regret it.\n",

      "Rating: 4, Review: EDIT: Review after 17 months usage There are hundreds of reviews for this device so let me get straight to the pros and cons as a normal user. Cons: 1. Battery life is not as great as many reviewers say, I'm not a heavy user but if I'm traveling and using phone data the device doesn't even last a day. A hard reset did help improving the battery performance but still it hardly lasts a day. 2. Samsung is providing 45W charging speed for the Plus and Ultra models but only 25W for S23, this is disappointing considering the phone is expensive. 3. Screen is usable in sunlight but it is not as bright as competition.  Pros 1. The camera, is hands down one the best in the market. See with still photos many Android phone makers are doing a great job even at half the price of S23 so I won't say that it is worth the price for stills but in videos, it absolutely shines and the results are worth every penny. 2. Performance is just great, SD 8gen 2 is great while shooting long timelapse, editing videos, and playing games...it does get warm but it is normal. I'm glad Samsung skipped Exynos for S23. 3. Design-wise the phone is pretty simple and geometrical with no gimmicks. Its size is perfect for one-hand use. Also, I love the new standardized look Samsung is going with all of its phones. 4. The flagship experience is best with Samsung. A 4-year software update means you get to enjoy the device for a long-long time. 5. Samsung's ecosystem is getting really good, if you're using more Samsung devices and Windows PC then you get something closer to Apple's Ecosystem. Phone-Link app works perfectly to transfer images, manage calls and even use phone as a webcam. 6. With One UI 6.1 the software experience has become even better. The phone feels way more polished now.  At current market price S23 is highly recommended.\n",

      "Rating: 4, Review: I got this product at 38k in big billon 128gb variant. At this price i will say i got best smartphone.  Probs 1) excellent design. 2) light weight pocket frendly device. 3) good camera 4) performance is really excellent.  Cons- 1) videography in night not gets good results. 2) little bit heating issue there if you use this device without case. But highlighting that heating issue does not affect to its performance. Thinking it is compact phone small heating problem is ignorable.    Average point 1) battery backup - you will get around 6 hrs battery backup. Now according to you you think is it sufficient to you or not but inwould say as a compact phone this is the best battery backup. If you use power 🔋 saving mode then trust me it is providing such a best results . (Performance will be down)     Charging time take around 1 hr using 25w original adapter. This was a review from my side. Thank you\n",

It's a Samsung flagship and they have got almost everything right - Fantastic cameras, Awesome AI, Amazing and Premium Display, Design, Size, Smooth and Excellent to use and to a good extent, even for high resource usage tasks. Battery consumption is also very well optimised and charges at a good speed.  The only minor improvement per me could be, a slightly higher capacity battery and faster charging.  Highly recommended S23, if you prefer a smaller and compact phone. With deals and offers, if you are able to get this for less than 45k, it's really worth.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: I upgraded to this from Redmi Note 4, so it is a very significant upgrade for me. Phone is fast, super responsive with no lag at all which is what you expect from a Snapdragon 8 gen 2 for Galaxy. I got 256 GB variant, so I have UFS 4.0 storage. Best camera and display, design wise looks awesome with thin and even bezels. Phone is a bit small which is perfect for my small palm but that means battery is also small and gives around 6 hours of screen on time. If you are just watching downloaded videos, you can get 9-10 hours of screen on time. One UI is awesome, just waiting for 6.1 to try out the AI for Galaxy. Overall a well balanced and powerful phone.\n",

Camera is good. it will take pictures close to reality. if you are relame/poco/oppo and other Chinese phone user and planning to switch to samsung then be mindful that camera selfi will take your real photo and will not apply lipstick and makeup and you may end up hating you own face.  In performance department as well it is excellent.  while charging phone get worm which is expected.\n",

Don't bother about battery life, it gives easily more than 1 day and there are wok around to improve the battery life - manage the performance profile switching from standard to light, and select 60hrtz refresh rate, and I am not a gamer, and hence for daily usage battery is sufficient, Samsung provides 4 years security and OS updates, camera clarity is very good, audio- cristal clear, oueUI is awesome, i was using Samsung M51 before, was sceptical between iPhone 14 as price is almost same, but iPhone is just show off, and only brand. Just go for it if you have budget, and don't bother on negative reviews.\n",

Processor, display, camera all are outstanding. So decision is yours, if you can sacrifise little bit on battery then go for it without a second thought.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Pros- 1. Battery is surprisingly good for a compact form factor. 2. OneUI is so well polished for this S23. And excellent software update support. 3. Camera is one of the best in the industry. 4. Snapdragon 8 Gen2 is a beast. Powerful as well as efficient.  Cons- 1. Can get warm sometime. 2. Charging speed is slow at 25W, should have been 45W instead.  Verdict- Best is class (Compact True Flagship)\n",
      "Rating: 4, Review: After almost 15 days of usage, Samsung S23 has lived up to my expectations. The obvious pros are its compact form factor and splendid display. During the initial few days of usage, the phone does get warm along the metal frame while multitasking or using heavy apps, but that has settled down now with continuous optimization. It still gets slightly warm but nothing too alarming. One suggestion for those users who take a lot of pictures or videos is that the 128 GB may seem to be a little short in storage. The AI based stuff already consumes quite a bit of space with regular software updates.\n",

The only concern is its battery and heating issue, I have been using this mobile for 1 week, and the heating issue always persists. We can get the battery until 8 pm. in moderate usage. I am never playing games on mobile. Display is top notch even better than the iPhone 14 pro. S23 Phone is better in so many segments compared to iPhone 14 pro. It never hangs, even if we use so many applications at a time. UI is 💯. Screenshot, call recorder,screen recorder, and 30X Zoom we will not get in iPhone 14 pro. Pros of mobile Display UI Lots of useful galaxy apps Network reception Call quality Compact size.  Cons. Battery backup Heating issue Huge price drop after 1 year.  Flipkart mobile exchange is very smooth, and they have given the best deal. I exchanged my oneplus with Rs 14000 and got a bank discount Rs. 8000 and prepaid offer got discount of Rs. 5000.

Camera's potrait and zoom pictures are excellent  But concern is that hope Samsung doesn't slow it down on future updates so as to promote newer galaxies\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: I purchased this phone on Flipkart GOAT sale. Got it in 47k 256 gb variant. Using it for almost a month. 1. Camera , display, performance is quite impressive. 2. I am not a heavy user and don't play games on small screen due to which i get excellent battery backup. I charge only once in a day and that too not 100%. Still i get entire day backp.  3. S23 series also got Samsung AI features so not much missing on anything which is there in S24 series.  S23 has Snapdragon 8 gen 2 processor compared to S24 and S24 plus. They have Exynos proc which is decent but not the best.  Very happy with this purchase. I will recommend this device at the price point which i got. It is best deal anyone can get.  Hope this review helps.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: I have been using this device for almost a year now, am just loving with device day by day❤️ especially security (knox), optimization, AI features of UI is too good.. My opinion 1. Design/ build quality: 5/5 for a compact phone 2. Performance: 5/5 not even a single issue or lag faced till now awesome optimization 3. Battery: 4/5 u can get 7.30 hours SOT with wifi and 6 hours on 5g data with one charge 4. Camera : 5/5 can beat iphone 15 too.. and it easily beats iphone 14 camera 5. Overview: one if the best compact phone to buy for official use\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: Must say a beautiful phone..finally happy to buy it over iphone.  Pros- Really good camera setup. Screen is super awesome. I love the haptics .. best till date. A lot of customisation. And last u r getting a computer.. by connecting it to a monitor thru samsung dex.  Cons- only battery charging time and battery is kind of low.  Overall a lovely experience go for it.. If u r confused bw iphone and samsung go for it and u will not be disappointed. 😊\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: I have been using this mobile for a while now. Here's my honest review based on my experience.  Battery Performance: The battery life on this mobile is quite impressive under moderate usage. It easily lasts a full day. However, I noticed that when using the 5G network, the battery drains heavily. This is common for all phones not a Samsung issue.  Design and Build: The slim design of the mobile is a major plus point. It fells comfortable to hold and is suitable for single hand usage. However, I noticed that the paint on aluminium frame is starting to wear off, which is disappointing. It's something that Samsung should address for better durability.  Camera: The camera, especially when using the portrait mode, captures good images with nice depth of field. However, I did notice a lack of clarity when zooming in on subjects.  Expert Raw Option: For photography enthusiasts or professionals, the expert RAW option is a standout feature. It provides more control and flexibility over the image settings, allowing for advanced editing and post- processing.  I hope this review helps you make an informed decision. Happy shopping!\n",
      "Rating: 3, Review: Product is good Cons: While using cam heating issue Battery back up less When we bought with 70K they should provide case and charming adoptor, but no case no charging adopotor  Pros: processor, cam, display, design, looks premium.  Note: When I try to sign in some other 2 numbers also coming that means it is used one. Where ever mobile number is required it is showing 2 other numbers which is not mine. Also I have seen a very minor scratch at the top of phone. Flipkart simply cheated customers.  So buyers, When you are buying expensive phones be careful and buy offline. My best suggestion.\n",
      "Rating: 4, Review: Best compact phone but there's no any update for VoNR yet. Only issue with Samsung flagships is that their fingerprint doesn't work well with any tempered glass.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: Iam sharing my experience after 12 days of excessive use Display is top notch you can feel how premium it is. Performance is on the another level I don't game lot and afterall it isn't a gaming device.it doesn't compromise And the main thing everyone is complaining about is the battery. So in my experience many of those guys doesn't used any flagship device before. This phone is compact and everything is packed in right here. Right now i use my device in max settings nothing is turned off.even though it has a smaller battery i do get 6hr of screen on time at the end of the day and 27%charge remains Which is great. And my device doesn't heat that much till now,but it gets warm when it is charging which is so obvious. After it is all aluminum so it do feel warm Till now everything is good....\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: It's a great phone to buy if u are looking for compact phone, but dont do the same mistake as I did . buy a thin slim case to enjoy the phones slim bezels . I bought a armored case and now besels looks thick\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: Pros 1)CAMERA- 5 out of 5. The ultrawide camera can get a little work done because in some environment photos seems a little dark then main camera. 2)DISPLAY- 5 OUT 5. The display is stunning and that 120hz is criminally smooth. 3)BATTERY- 4.5 out of 5. 3900mah feels good Enough for me .But a little bit more mah and it would me much appreciated. 4)SOUND- 4 OUT OF 5. With dolby atmos stereo speakers sounds great. But the bass seems a little low than its bigger sibling s23+. 5)STORAGE AND RAM- 5 OUT 5. 256gb variant is good enough for me and also because this variant comes with ufs 4.0 the overall experience is way better. And with 8gb ram everday task is just seamless with this much ram i have stopped the habit of removing apps from recent you can just use a app and then press home button and then go of with your day and when you want you can retrieve the same app from where you left on next day and also with ram you extend it upto 16gb. 6)PERFORMANCE- 5 OUT 5 . SNAPDRAGON 8 GEN 2 performs great. And i dont think i have to tell how good day to day task performs. So i will go on heavy task the only heavy task i do is playing genshin and yeah it you can play it on high settings at 30 fps yeah it does get a little bit of frame drops and hitches but overall it performs good if you play it on mid settings it goes pretty well the only problem what gets in way is battery backup but it also gets solves if you play it on low settings and if you do that you can get a play time of almost 3 hours on full charge easy.\n",
      "Rating: 4, Review: Good,Compact, more battery then expected, best for normal use, better than iPhone 13 or 14, Android has much more power and customization as compared to any other OS. In this scenario samsung s23 is best.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: Switch from Pixel 7,before that from iPhone 13. My decision of switching was 💯 % correct.If samsung ditched SD chipset in smaller S series than that will be a huge bummer 😔. So far so good but SD chipset in S23 is the original matchmaker.I don't know about Exynos, let's see in coming years. Samsung update policy will keep it afresh I guess !\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Long term review, moving from apple to samsung  Battery is great for normal usage. For gamers or heavy usage, its good but wont last whole day probably. Camera is good. Gameplay(bgmi/genshin) great. Wont lag much, might see some frame drops in bgmi customs otherwise no. Look and feel is very premium especially for the green color. Compared to apple 120 refresh rate is great. We have telephoto zoom. Comparable battery life. No lags while using the phone.  Cons: UI can use some improvements. Picture and picture mode can be improved. Can give 90 hz feature also (force or adaptive). Battery is good, but it can get better.  Will update if i find some more pros and cons.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: Very good phone but pricing is a bit higher. Battery backup is above average but samsung needs to improve changing technology. 15w charger takes almost 90 minutes but 25w also takes 75-80 min from 0-100. Camera is awesome. RAM Management is fabulous. Heating issue after some heavy tasks and even after using 10 min of camera app. Samsung needs to fix it with software update.\n",

A big drawback since it has one of the best processor i didn't expect this. And it has some glitches while using some apps. I mean for a 50k phone this is not something that i signed up for.

Major thing is this phone heats... it's in red hot form whenever you'll use it for multitasking more than half an hour. In this summer time it's too hot to use. Even using rubber backcase you will feel the heat. And scree is also hot.  If you are Samsung interface lover and wants Samsung only like me... then you should go with S21FE in same budget.\n",

Working like a brand new. 2. Unbeatable camera at this price, even some people ask are these pictures clicked from DSLR. Telephoto lens is capturing great pictures even in low light. 3. Good quality of display. 4. Feels premium as it's very sleek and light weight. 5. Fast charging, charges the phone in 1 hour 10 minutes. 6. Ram management is amazing.  Cons. (If you're not a normal user) 1. Battery gives screen on time of 5-6 hours. Use Power Saving for SOT of 6.5-7 hours. 2. Do switch to power saving mode at night before sleeping. My phone goes 13% to 0% while not on power saving mode at night. 3. Performance is not like Snapdragon but it's more than enough for daily task and for playing normal games.  Being a normal user I can assure you that you're not going to regret buying this.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: I was looking at this phone before BBD and it was at the lowest price at that time, I didn't get it at lowest price but lower price of 33k and even at this price this device worth a lot.  Lavender color was my last choice but other options were out of stock so had to go with it. But believe me this color is the best of all.  Even back is plastic it doesn't look cheap.  My verdict. Camera : 5 Display : 5 Battery : 3.5 Performance : 4.5 Build : 4.5  Bonus: You get water and dust resistance along with wireless charging which is absent in this range.  Conclusion: if your priority is not gaming and battery life then this device is for you.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: The camera is one of its shining features, capturing high-quality images that are sharp, vibrant, and full of detail. Whether you're snapping a quick photo or recording a video, the camera performs exceptionally well.  The display is another strong point. It offers a clear, crisp viewing experience with excellent color reproduction. Whether you're browsing the web, watching videos, or playing games, the display delivers a visually pleasing experience.  However, the battery life leaves something to be desired. Despite the impressive performance of the camera and display, the battery doesn't seem to hold up as well. It drains faster than expected, which can be inconvenient for users who are frequently on the go and rely on their phone throughout the day.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Best camera phone Avg battery Best performance S21fe = 1 ,iPhone13 =0\n",
      "Rating: 4, Review: Been using this phone as my primary phone for 4 days now. So a brief opinion I can provide about various aspects of the phone.  1. Display: Quite good, bright and nice-looking. No visibility issue in sun. Touch experience is good, the 120 hz refresh rate works fine.  2. Battery: With two sims and general office works/photo/video watch/phone call etc, it manages to last just the day-long. I unplug it ar 100 percent at 9 am, leave for office and return at 9 pm with nearly 30 percent battery remaining. It's not great, I know, but manageable. Actually samsung should come up with a faster charging capacity. It takes about one and a half hour to fully charge from 0.  3. Camera: Front camera: A bit better than average, that's all. Back camera: Quite good, but again I have observed performance inconsistency. Compared to iPhone camera, there's still way to go. Colors are good, but not 100% natural.  4. Sound: No issue with clarity but lacks slightly in loudness. My 13k realme phone is louder (with clarity). But not much of an issue.  5. Call quality: Very good. No network fluctuations, no mic issue observed so far.  6. Aesthetics: Many don't really bother about this part. The positioning of power and volume keys are perfect. But the on-screen fingerprint scanner could've been better positioned. Reaching that much down is not very comfortable.  7. Performance: On regular usage I didn't find any lag. It's very smooth actually. But I'm no gamer, hence cannot comment about its gaming performance. Device is prone to getting warm, but not hot.  8. Network: I am not sure it's device issue or not, but with both my jio and Airtel sims, I often find slow data speed. My point is, upgrading from a 4G phone to a 5G one, no data speed improvement is observed.  Overall I'd say, under a 35k price tag, this phone is good.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: I was extremely disappointed during first two to three days as the mobile was heating badly and battery life was bad and camera was not that great. I put return request as well. But from third day on wards, mobile heating issue was solved by keeping most of the apps in deep sleep mode. Battery life also improved a bit. My daily usage is office emails, teams, photo and video and extreme browsing. Battery gets drained 10% percent on 4g per 1 hour. I also capped the battery to 85% max charging to increase battery life. Charging takes one hour to become full(85%) Camera: I was using pixel4a for past two years. To say I am fan of pixel excellent computational photography. I was about to buy pixel 6a to continue my fandom but was sceptical about mobile signal issue, and lack of water proofing as i need water proofing and strong glass as my one year baby may drop the mobile accidentally or throw the mobile. So I bought this one expecting same quality of photos compare to pixel. My initial experience for first three days was not satisfactory. I couldn't get the same HDR quality pics or top class night sight photos. So I searched everywhere in internet to find gcam mode and tried many gcam mode but none was working. From third day onwards, i tried to understand the camera and editing options. Enabling motion mode made the pics blurry or s21 Fe camera is not intelligent enough to capture the best shot unlike pixel. So most of the photos were washed out due to motion mode. Now I am able to get good quality pics during good lighting conditions after disabling motion mode. And the best part of the editing feature is remaster image. When you use this option, samsung camera remaster the picture and stabilizes the image further. Also another good part of the cam is we can increase lighting for particular face when multiple people are in the picture. Results are very impressive due this as i can choose which one to be illuminated. Also i found working gcam for HDR pictures and night mode MGC by BGC. Because of this i switch to gcam when I am not satisfied with the inbuilt camera. I can confidently say after one week, i use gcam seldom. One great thing about samsung camera is pro mode. It allows me to play with many options and different lighting conditions. I came to know the camera hardware is extremely good and if you learn the pro camera, you can get super quality pictures. It's because of the software, pictures by this camera is some times fall under mid range. Video quality is excellent. Ois makes the video stable and i could capture many videos of my one year old kid and i loved the video quality. I would say it is better than pixel camera in good lighting conditions. Performance: mobile is snappy and i never saw any single occurance of slowness. It was fast and responsive. finger print is also very good, sensor is very good. Face detection is also very good and quick to respond. Display: display is bright and adaptive display is very good. Video watching in this mobile is way better than pixel. picture clarity is awesome. Victus glass is very strong, i don't have screen guard yet, my mobile fallen from three to five feet height more than ten times already but there is no single scratch on the glass. Software update: another good thing about this mobile is software update. I got latest security patch today which is way better than pixel . Samsung provides four years of Android upgrades and five years of security updates. This is better than Google. Kudos to samsung for that.  Verdict: If you are looking for top class mobile with long term support, strong build quality, top class display and performance this mobile is for you. If you want flagship camera, then go for s22+. Overall i am very happy with this mobile and glad that i cancelled my return request (submitted in first two days).\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Fantastic Device! Best in Segment just close your eyes and go for this🔥 being a Tech geek i heard that this phone has some crazy Heating issues and won't be surviving a full day with normal usage but even after a Heavy use(2 hours Codm,almost 10-15 mins of camera usage, Video Streaming at Highest quality+full brightness, etc) this phone easily ends with 15-20% battery left by the time it's 11:30-12AM. The main usp of this phone are its cameras and Display! I mean it's a Samsung S series phone and i guess that would be enough to tell what would be the quality of them both! Though Exynos 2100 heats up but not up to that extent which the youtubers were telling so close your eyes and go for it you will be enjoying worth every penny you will spend of this device.

      "Rating: 5, Review: Moto Edge 50 Fusion (12GB/256GB): A Sleek Everyday Powerhouse (Review)  You're spot on about the Moto Edge 50 Fusion (12GB/256GB) being a compelling choice. The 12GB RAM paired with the Snapdragon 7s Gen 2 processor is a fantastic combination, especially in this price segment. This translates to impressive performance for everyday tasks like browsing, social media, and running productivity apps. There's no lag, making it a joy to use for daily activities. Long-Lasting Power (with a Caveat): The 5000mAh battery is a big plus, but some initial optimization might be required to achieve optimal battery life. The good news is that after optimization, you can expect dependable power to last a full day on a single charge. 12GB/256 Storage King: Never worry about running out of space again. The massive 256GB storage allows you to download apps, store photos, and keep videos without worrying about filling it up anytime soon. Capable Camera for Everyday Snaps: The camera system might not boast every high-end feature, but it delivers well for everyday use. The 50MP main sensor captures crisp photos, and the 13MP ultrawide lens is a great addition for capturing expansive scenes. While there's no dedicated telephoto lens for zooming in, the overall camera setup is well-suited for casual photography needs. Stunning Visuals: The 144Hz pOLED display is a true highlight. This display offers a buttery smooth experience, vibrant colors, and makes everything from browsing the web to watching videos a pleasure. Premium Design in Your Hand: The phone's sleek design feels luxurious and is sure to turn heads. It has a premium look and feels that rivals more expensive options. Clean Software Experience: Stock Android 14 keeps things simple and bloatware-free. You'll get a clean interface and the latest updates directly from Google. Beyond Your Observations: Not a Gaming Beast: The Snapdragon 7s Gen 2, while powerful for everyday tasks, might struggle with demanding games at the highest settings. If mobile gaming is a major priority, you might want to consider a phone with a more powerful graphics processor. The Final Verdict: The Moto Edge 50 Fusion (12GB/256GB) is an excellent choice for users seeking a powerful and smooth experience for everyday tasks. It boasts a beautiful display, ample storage, a capable camera, and a long-lasting battery (with some optimization). With its premium design and clean software, this phone offers excellent value for its price segment. If you're a casual gamer and prioritize a phone for everyday use, photos, and entertainment, the Moto Edge 50 Fusion (12GB/256GB) is definitely worth considering.\n",

I took some pictures with its camera, which were a bit saturated but overall the pictures were quite good. Its video quality is the same but its OIS is much better than other phones. Talking about battery backup, after charging I used it throughout the day and it lasted for 8 hours. In the end I would say that its pink variant is very suitable for girls.\n",

Basically u can get flagship and clean software experience .The performance is not up to that mark like flagship but u don't feel any problem in day to day usage . Based on my experience CAMERA-4.5/5 It boost the colors a bit but it does not ruin your pictures. BATTERY-5/5 I got 7 to 8 hrs of SOT in my heavy usage .Although u can get up to 1.5 to 2 day of Battery backup in moderate usage. U get a 68w charger brick which charge ur phone within 45 m DISPLAY- 5/5 U get a bright and beautiful curve display with GG protection with higher refresh rate of 144 hz  When I got the product it has some bugs and i got an update after 3 days of receiving the product and the bug got fixed . 1-The camera shutter lag has got fixed and fast. 2-Whenever I exit the camera app the auto brightness was not working but after update it got fixed. Many people r bit afraid to buy because of the not giving timely sofware update of moto . But I think they will fix with their new hello moto ui as i got an update after 3 days of receiving the unit Don't think twice just go for it......\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: First time uses Moto smartphones. Go for it without any hesitation. Every thing is up to mark in this price segment. Just ignore negative comments.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: If anyone is looking for a review of this phone, then he/she can read this post..... or I recommend you'll to watch YouTube reviews for better understanding🫠  Pros : 1. The Motorola Edge 50 Fusion offers a premium design with a glass front, vegan leather back, and IP68 rating. 2. The 6.7-inch pOLED display delivers vibrant colors and a smooth 144Hz refresh rate, protected by Gorilla Glass 5. 3. Powered by the Snapdragon 7s Gen 2 chipset and running Android 14, the phone provides smooth performance for everyday tasks. 4. The triple camera setup, led by a 50MP primary sensor, captures detailed shots in good lighting conditions. 5. With a 5,000mAh battery and 68W fast charging support, the Edge 50 Fusion offers decent battery life and quick top-ups.  Cons: 1. Camera hangs sometimes. 2. Low light photography is not quite good.  Overall, the Motorola Edge 50 Fusion is a well-rounded smartphone that balances features and value, making it a worthy consideration for those seeking a device with a focus on design and display quality.  Highly Recommended...💯\n",

However, this is the second Motorola phone I've had, and I'm deducting two stars due to a persistent mic issue. On both phones, my voice gets distorted during calls. I've checked this in different locations, so it's not a signal issue; it's definitely a problem with the mic. Motorola should address this issue.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Good product by Motorola. Only one negative point is that battery drains fastly. Major positives- No bloatwares and unnecessary apps like other companies have. Thin and light weight although it have 5000 mah battery. Water and dust proof. Immersive poled display. fast and responsive processor. Beautiful curved and bezel less display. width is less so easy to grip. Great camera quality with extra punchiness makes pics more attractive. Moto's personalised UI is easy to operate and comes with some new cool features. Fast 68watt charger does the job. It doesn't have it's own gallery and file manager, but u can use Google gallery and Google files. These all things makes it worthy to buy.\n",
      "Rating: 4, Review: Moto has literally it this time with Edge 50 Fusion.  Build Quality and Design - Simplistically ergonomic. Display - The best curved OLED display in this segment hands-down and it makes it very easy to hold the phone. Battery - Astounding battery backup even being used continuously on 5G network and/or WiFi. SOT of 6 hours. Cameras - Brand is listening to us. Both the cameras capture amazing social media ready images. Multimedia - Dolby Atmos makes a big difference. It enhances this phone's capabilities. UI - Hello UI is better than most of the android skins. It is implemented beautifully with enough customization. Performance - Although the processor could have been better, it is still buttery smooth because of the Hello UI. Haptics - It is basic for this price but not a showstopper.\n",

The battery will easily last you for a day and even if it doesn't you can use the fast charger to charge your phone quickly. The display is excellent however I am finding it a little difficult to find a tempered glass because of the curve screen.  Good thing is that there is very little bloatware and you can disable that so you will not get any unnecessary notifications at least that is what I have seen so far.

      "Rating: 5, Review: The photo is a sample , turned on all post processing. The phone seems like a complete package. Very good display, a bit taller. You won't get video of that aspect ratio most the time so can't utilise that much screen when playing video. But it make it more useful in daily task like when typing you will get more screen area for the apps.  Sound is good. Not rating very good. But works fine for the budget. Camera is nice. ( I do have iPhone 13), the photo after post processing is better than iPhone 13. People with s23, iphone are praising the output which is better than their. Front camera is extremely sharp at the hands length which very good for selfie. Wide angle lens has autofocus. It is not as good as main camera. Little bit softer. The images are useful though. Nfc for this budget is good. I can pay at pos machine with that. Felt very convenient. I am not into series gaming now. So can't tell more about the performance. Software is very good. No bugs felt so far after 4 weeks of use. No bloatware as well\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Camera Sharpness is good. Picture quality is good. the dynamic range could be better though i think it is just a software problem otherwise the camera sensor is good.  Battery it is good, even after an entire day of usage in mixed usages it is left with 20% of the charge left. the charging speed is very very good. the standby on the other hand can be improved. again thats a software feature and could be enhanced by a software update.  Display it is strikingly good at this price. colors are accurate and punchy. The display is of very good quality. you can take it toe to toe with some high end phones.  Design. Although the design is good, it depends on the personal preference. on my usage i find it to be a sleek device and lightweight on your hand.  Performance i do not play games. just some casual browsings and other messaging and stuff. i used it as an official device, it turns out the performance is good, there are some high performance phones at this price but if your aim is not to play games then it will do you good.\n",

      "Rating: 4, Review: I recently purchased the Motorola 50 Fusion, and I must say, I'm quite impressed! The camera is excellent, capturing stunning photos with great detail and vibrant colors. The phone is super lightweight, making it easy to carry around without feeling bulky.  One of the standout features for me is the quick charging capability. It saves me so much time and keeps me going throughout the day without constantly worrying about battery life. Another big plus is the absence of bloatware, which means a cleaner and smoother user experience.  The 5G connectivity is top-notch, providing fast and reliable internet speeds. Overall, it's a fantastic phone with great features. The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is that there's always room for a bit of improvement. Highly recommended!\n",

      "Rating: 4, Review: My Honest Review (after using it for more than a week) 1) Display: Before buying this phone I had realme x7 Max which had amoled fhd+ display with 409 PPI and this phone has 393 PPI so I can spot the difference in the sharpness and quality which I missed out during my reasearch. The rest aspects of display are good. 2) Camera: Again, my old phone had 64mp rear so I could see better details after zooming in the clicked picture or live 4k video compared to this phone. But, this phone has good after processing functionality so it might be a bit satisfactory. 3) Software: By far it's good. Did not feel jittery anywhere apart from camera app opening and closing times but it's rare. 4) Battery: I never charge my phone to 100%. I always charge it within the 35-85% range which will help to prolong the life and I'm not a heavy user so I can easily get 5.30 hours of sot before the next charge which roughly takes about 15-20 minutes. And, also I didn't enable the Charge boost to avoid overheating the battery while charging. So, this department is great. 5) others: Didn't face any calling issues, even wifi calling experience is good. Difficulty in finding the right case for the phone to ensure the safety so need to use it carefully. Idle drain 3% at night at 120hz RR, 4%-5% at night at 144hz RR.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Moto Edge 50 Fusion (12GB/256GB): A Sleek Everyday Powerhouse (Review)  You're spot on about the Moto Edge 50 Fusion (12GB/256GB) being a compelling choice. The 12GB RAM paired with the Snapdragon 7s Gen 2 processor is a fantastic combination, especially in this price segment. This translates to impressive performance for everyday tasks like browsing, social media, and running productivity apps. There's no lag, making it a joy to use for daily activities. Long-Lasting Power (with a Caveat): The 5000mAh battery is a big plus, but some initial optimization might be required to achieve optimal battery life. The good news is that after optimization, you can expect dependable power to last a full day on a single charge. 12GB/256 Storage King: Never worry about running out of space again. The massive 256GB storage allows you to download apps, store photos, and keep videos without worrying about filling it up anytime soon. Capable Camera for Everyday Snaps: The camera system might not boast every high-end feature, but it delivers well for everyday use. The 50MP main sensor captures crisp photos, and the 13MP ultrawide lens is a great addition for capturing expansive scenes. While there's no dedicated telephoto lens for zooming in, the overall camera setup is well-suited for casual photography needs. Stunning Visuals: The 144Hz pOLED display is a true highlight. This display offers a buttery smooth experience, vibrant colors, and makes everything from browsing the web to watching videos a pleasure. Premium Design in Your Hand: The phone's sleek design feels luxurious and is sure to turn heads. It has a premium look and feels that rivals more expensive options. Clean Software Experience: Stock Android 14 keeps things simple and bloatware-free. You'll get a clean interface and the latest updates directly from Google. Beyond Your Observations: Not a Gaming Beast: The Snapdragon 7s Gen 2, while powerful for everyday tasks, might struggle with demanding games at the highest settings. If mobile gaming is a major priority, you might want to consider a phone with a more powerful graphics processor. The Final Verdict: The Moto Edge 50 Fusion (12GB/256GB) is an excellent choice for users seeking a powerful and smooth experience for everyday tasks. It boasts a beautiful display, ample storage, a capable camera, and a long-lasting battery (with some optimization). With its premium design and clean software, this phone offers excellent value for its price segment. If you're a casual gamer and prioritize a phone for everyday use, photos, and entertainment, the Moto Edge 50 Fusion (12GB/256GB) is definitely worth considering.\n",

When tested jio 5g speed was around 450Mbps.  Sound quality with stereo speaker is better than asked. I feared about the heating issue but there is no much heating while using the device.  Camera performance is good. Overall am very much satisfied with the purchase. Thank you Motorola and Flipkart  Design 5/5 Display 5/5 Battery 5/5 Camera 4/5 Performance 5/5 Charging time 4/5 Battery backup 4/5.\n",

      "Rating: 4, Review: This Phone is the best in the price range, It is as I expected but I have seen a disadvantage till now is that you have to avoid using a uv protector glass (specially glue while installing uv protector) with this phone. Because most of the time it damages the sensors or speakers. And the company also doesn't accept damage caused by using a uv protector glass.\n",

      "Rating: 4, Review: I have liked this phone very much. It is very thin and very light too but what I liked the most is its girly hot pink look and its back leather finish. I took some pictures with its camera, which were a bit saturated but overall the pictures were quite good. Its video quality is the same but its OIS is much better than other phones. Talking about battery backup, after charging I used it throughout the day and it lasted for 8 hours. In the end I would say that its pink variant is very suitable for girls.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Fantastic product in this price range . Basically u can get flagship and clean software experience .The performance is not up to that mark like flagship but u don't feel any problem in day to day usage . Based on my experience CAMERA-4.5/5 It boost the colors a bit but it does not ruin your pictures. BATTERY-5/5 I got 7 to 8 hrs of SOT in my heavy usage .Although u can get up to 1.5 to 2 day of Battery backup in moderate usage. U get a 68w charger brick which charge ur phone within 45 m DISPLAY- 5/5 U get a bright and beautiful curve display with GG protection with higher refresh rate of 144 hz  When I got the product it has some bugs and i got an update after 3 days of receiving the product and the bug got fixed . 1-The camera shutter lag has got fixed and fast. 2-Whenever I exit the camera app the auto brightness was not working but after update it got fixed. Many people r bit afraid to buy because of the not giving timely sofware update of moto . But I think they will fix with their new hello moto ui as i got an update after 3 days of receiving the unit Don't think twice just go for it......\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: First time uses Moto smartphones. Go for it without any hesitation. Every thing is up to mark in this price segment. Just ignore negative comments.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: If anyone is looking for a review of this phone, then he/she can read this post..... or I recommend you'll to watch YouTube reviews for better understanding🫠  Pros : 1. The Motorola Edge 50 Fusion offers a premium design with a glass front, vegan leather back, and IP68 rating. 2. The 6.7-inch pOLED display delivers vibrant colors and a smooth 144Hz refresh rate, protected by Gorilla Glass 5. 3. Powered by the Snapdragon 7s Gen 2 chipset and running Android 14, the phone provides smooth performance for everyday tasks. 4. The triple camera setup, led by a 50MP primary sensor, captures detailed shots in good lighting conditions. 5. With a 5,000mAh battery and 68W fast charging support, the Edge 50 Fusion offers decent battery life and quick top-ups.  Cons: 1. Camera hangs sometimes. 2. Low light photography is not quite good.  Overall, the Motorola Edge 50 Fusion is a well-rounded smartphone that balances features and value, making it a worthy consideration for those seeking a device with a focus on design and display quality.  Highly Recommended...💯\n",

      "Rating: 3, Review: The phone looks good and operates smoothly. The OS is clean Android, the camera is good, and the battery life is strong. However, this is the second Motorola phone I've had, and I'm deducting two stars due to a persistent mic issue. On both phones, my voice gets distorted during calls. I've checked this in different locations, so it's not a signal issue; it's definitely a problem with the mic. Motorola should address this issue.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Good product by Motorola. Only one negative point is that battery drains fastly. Major positives- No bloatwares and unnecessary apps like other companies have. Thin and light weight although it have 5000 mah battery. Water and dust proof. Immersive poled display. fast and responsive processor. Beautiful curved and bezel less display. width is less so easy to grip. Great camera quality with extra punchiness makes pics more attractive. Moto's personalised UI is easy to operate and comes with some new cool features. Fast 68watt charger does the job. It doesn't have it's own gallery and file manager, but u can use Google gallery and Google files. These all things makes it worthy to buy.\n",
      "Rating: 4, Review: Moto has literally it this time with Edge 50 Fusion.  Build Quality and Design - Simplistically ergonomic. Display - The best curved OLED display in this segment hands-down and it makes it very easy to hold the phone. Battery - Astounding battery backup even being used continuously on 5G network and/or WiFi. SOT of 6 hours. Cameras - Brand is listening to us. Both the cameras capture amazing social media ready images. Multimedia - Dolby Atmos makes a big difference. It enhances this phone's capabilities. UI - Hello UI is better than most of the android skins. It is implemented beautifully with enough customization. Performance - Although the processor could have been better, it is still buttery smooth because of the Hello UI. Haptics - It is basic for this price but not a showstopper.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Moved from iPhone 12 to this device because I was bored of using Apple. Did not expect much but the phone is pretty decent. The battery will easily last you for a day and even if it doesn't you can use the fast charger to charge your phone quickly. The display is excellent however I am finding it a little difficult to find a tempered glass because of the curve screen.  Good thing is that there is very little bloatware and you can disable that so you will not get any unnecessary notifications at least that is what I have seen so far. Overall a complete value for money device\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: The photo is a sample , turned on all post processing. The phone seems like a complete package. Very good display, a bit taller. You won't get video of that aspect ratio most the time so can't utilise that much screen when playing video. But it make it more useful in daily task like when typing you will get more screen area for the apps.  Sound is good. Not rating very good. But works fine for the budget. Camera is nice. ( I do have iPhone 13), the photo after post processing is better than iPhone 13. People with s23, iphone are praising the output which is better than their. Front camera is extremely sharp at the hands length which very good for selfie. Wide angle lens has autofocus. It is not as good as main camera. Little bit softer. The images are useful though. Nfc for this budget is good. I can pay at pos machine with that. Felt very convenient. I am not into series gaming now. So can't tell more about the performance. Software is very good. No bugs felt so far after 4 weeks of use. No bloatware as well\n",

Display it is strikingly good at this price. colors are accurate and punchy. The display is of very good quality. you can take it toe to toe with some high end phones.  Design. Although the design is good, it depends on the personal preference. on my usage i find it to be a sleek device and lightweight on your hand.

      "Rating: 5, Review: Moto Edge 50 Fusion (12GB/256GB): A Sleek Everyday Powerhouse (Review)  You're spot on about the Moto Edge 50 Fusion (12GB/256GB) being a compelling choice. The 12GB RAM paired with the Snapdragon 7s Gen 2 processor is a fantastic combination, especially in this price segment. This translates to impressive performance for everyday tasks like browsing, social media, and running productivity apps. There's no lag, making it a joy to use for daily activities. Long-Lasting Power (with a Caveat): The 5000mAh battery is a big plus, but some initial optimization might be required to achieve optimal battery life. The good news is that after optimization, you can expect dependable power to last a full day on a single charge. 12GB/256 Storage King: Never worry about running out of space again. The massive 256GB storage allows you to download apps, store photos, and keep videos without worrying about filling it up anytime soon. Capable Camera for Everyday Snaps: The camera system might not boast every high-end feature, but it delivers well for everyday use. The 50MP main sensor captures crisp photos, and the 13MP ultrawide lens is a great addition for capturing expansive scenes. While there's no dedicated telephoto lens for zooming in, the overall camera setup is well-suited for casual photography needs. Stunning Visuals: The 144Hz pOLED display is a true highlight. This display offers a buttery smooth experience, vibrant colors, and makes everything from browsing the web to watching videos a pleasure. Premium Design in Your Hand: The phone's sleek design feels luxurious and is sure to turn heads. It has a premium look and feels that rivals more expensive options. Clean Software Experience: Stock Android 14 keeps things simple and bloatware-free. You'll get a clean interface and the latest updates directly from Google. Beyond Your Observations: Not a Gaming Beast: The Snapdragon 7s Gen 2, while powerful for everyday tasks, might struggle with demanding games at the highest settings. If mobile gaming is a major priority, you might want to consider a phone with a more powerful graphics processor. The Final Verdict: The Moto Edge 50 Fusion (12GB/256GB) is an excellent choice for users seeking a powerful and smooth experience for everyday tasks. It boasts a beautiful display, ample storage, a capable camera, and a long-lasting battery (with some optimization). With its premium design and clean software, this phone offers excellent value for its price segment. If you're a casual gamer and prioritize a phone for everyday use, photos, and entertainment, the Moto Edge 50 Fusion (12GB/256GB) is definitely worth considering.\n",

      "Rating: 4, Review: This Phone is the best in the price range, It is as I expected but I have seen a disadvantage till now is that you have to avoid using a uv protector glass (specially glue while installing uv protector) with this phone. Because most of the time it damages the sensors or speakers. And the company also doesn't accept damage caused by using a uv protector glass.\n",

I took some pictures with its camera, which were a bit saturated but overall the pictures were quite good. Its video quality is the same but its OIS is much better than other phones. Talking about battery backup, after charging I used it throughout the day and it lasted for 8 hours. In the end I would say that its pink variant is very suitable for girls.\n",

Basically u can get flagship and clean software experience .The performance is not up to that mark like flagship but u don't feel any problem in day to day usage . Based on my experience CAMERA-4.5/5 It boost the colors a bit but it does not ruin your pictures. BATTERY-5/5 I got 7 to 8 hrs of SOT in my heavy usage .Although u can get up to 1.5 to 2 day of Battery backup in moderate usage. U get a 68w charger brick which charge ur phone within 45 m DISPLAY- 5/5 U get a bright and beautiful curve display with GG protection with higher refresh rate of 144 hz  When I got the product it has some bugs and i got an update after 3 days of receiving the product and the bug got fixed . 1-The camera shutter lag has got fixed and fast. 2-Whenever I exit the camera app the auto brightness was not working but after update it got fixed. Many people r bit afraid to buy because of the not giving timely sofware update of moto . But I think they will fix with their new hello moto ui as i got an update after 3 days of receiving the unit Don't think twice just go for it......\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: First time uses Moto smartphones. Go for it without any hesitation. Every thing is up to mark in this price segment. Just ignore negative comments.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: If anyone is looking for a review of this phone, then he/she can read this post..... or I recommend you'll to watch YouTube reviews for better understanding🫠  Pros : 1. The Motorola Edge 50 Fusion offers a premium design with a glass front, vegan leather back, and IP68 rating. 2. The 6.7-inch pOLED display delivers vibrant colors and a smooth 144Hz refresh rate, protected by Gorilla Glass 5. 3. Powered by the Snapdragon 7s Gen 2 chipset and running Android 14, the phone provides smooth performance for everyday tasks. 4. The triple camera setup, led by a 50MP primary sensor, captures detailed shots in good lighting conditions. 5. With a 5,000mAh battery and 68W fast charging support, the Edge 50 Fusion offers decent battery life and quick top-ups.  Cons: 1. Camera hangs sometimes. 2. Low light photography is not quite good.  Overall, the Motorola Edge 50 Fusion is a well-rounded smartphone that balances features and value, making it a worthy consideration for those seeking a device with a focus on design and display quality.  Highly Recommended...💯\n",

      "Rating: 3, Review: The phone looks good and operates smoothly. The OS is clean Android, the camera is good, and the battery life is strong. However, this is the second Motorola phone I've had, and I'm deducting two stars due to a persistent mic issue. On both phones, my voice gets distorted during calls. I've checked this in different locations, so it's not a signal issue; it's definitely a problem with the mic. Motorola should address this issue.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Good product by Motorola. Only one negative point is that battery drains fastly. Major positives- No bloatwares and unnecessary apps like other companies have. Thin and light weight although it have 5000 mah battery. Water and dust proof. Immersive poled display. fast and responsive processor. Beautiful curved and bezel less display. width is less so easy to grip. Great camera quality with extra punchiness makes pics more attractive. Moto's personalised UI is easy to operate and comes with some new cool features. Fast 68watt charger does the job. It doesn't have it's own gallery and file manager, but u can use Google gallery and Google files. These all things makes it worthy to buy.\n",
      "Rating: 4, Review: Moto has literally it this time with Edge 50 Fusion.  Build Quality and Design - Simplistically ergonomic. Display - The best curved OLED display in this segment hands-down and it makes it very easy to hold the phone. Battery - Astounding battery backup even being used continuously on 5G network and/or WiFi. SOT of 6 hours. Cameras - Brand is listening to us. Both the cameras capture amazing social media ready images. Multimedia - Dolby Atmos makes a big difference. It enhances this phone's capabilities. UI - Hello UI is better than most of the android skins. It is implemented beautifully with enough customization. Performance - Although the processor could have been better, it is still buttery smooth because of the Hello UI. Haptics - It is basic for this price but not a showstopper.\n",

The battery will easily last you for a day and even if it doesn't you can use the fast charger to charge your phone quickly. The display is excellent however I am finding it a little difficult to find a tempered glass because of the curve screen.  Good thing is that there is very little bloatware and you can disable that so you will not get any unnecessary notifications at least that is what I have seen so far. Overall a complete value for money device\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: The photo is a sample , turned on all post processing. The phone seems like a complete package. Very good display, a bit taller. You won't get video of that aspect ratio most the time so can't utilise that much screen when playing video. But it make it more useful in daily task like when typing you will get more screen area for the apps.  Sound is good. Not rating very good. But works fine for the budget. Camera is nice. ( I do have iPhone 13), the photo after post processing is better than iPhone 13. People with s23, iphone are praising the output which is better than their. Front camera is extremely sharp at the hands length which very good for selfie. Wide angle lens has autofocus. It is not as good as main camera. Little bit softer. The images are useful though. Nfc for this budget is good. I can pay at pos machine with that. Felt very convenient. I am not into series gaming now. So can't tell more about the performance. Software is very good. No bugs felt so far after 4 weeks of use. No bloatware as well\n",

Battery it is good, even after an entire day of usage in mixed usages it is left with 20% of the charge left. the charging speed is very very good. the standby on the other hand can be improved. again thats a software feature and could be enhanced by a software update.  Display it is strikingly good at this price. colors are accurate and punchy. The display is of very good quality. you can take it toe to toe with some high end phones.  Design. Although the design is good, it depends on the personal preference. on my usage i find it to be a sleek device and lightweight on your hand.  Performance i do not play games. just some casual browsings and other messaging and stuff. i used it as an official device, it turns out the performance is good, there are some high performance phones at this price but if your aim is not to play games then it will do you good.\n",

I was impressed with the night photography. The best cameras.  3. Screen: Very impressive screen, eye comfort, and curved screen gives a very unique look to the phone.  4.

      "Rating: 5, Review: Do not believe the negative reviews. This is an amazing phone. I've switched from iPhone 11 and I'm in love with this already. I also got iPhone 14 plus for my wife but believe me this is much better than iPhone interms of display.  Display - 10/10 - The display is awesome. Crystal clear 1.5k resolution. The colours are punchy and lively. I'm using a 120Hz refresh rate and it's smooth as butter. Edge to edge display is really awesome. If I have to pick one thing about the phone then it's the display.  Camera - 9/10 - I haven't tested the camera a lot but the photos are coming really well.  Battery - 10/10 - No heat at all when charging the phone and it's changing insanely fast. I got a 128 watt charger along with this phone and it goes 0% to 100% in just 20 min. And I'm easily getting one day. I'm a medium-heavy user and I'm getting one day charging easily.  Performance - 9/10 - I got 12GB Ram version and no lags whatsoever. I played a few games and did not see any frame drops or lags. And it's handling high graphic settings like it's nothing.  Design -9/10 - it's very sleek and thin. I got the Lavender colour and I'm in love with it. When you hold it, it feels like a 60k-70k premium phone.  Overall Verdict - I have been an iPhone user for the past few years and I got bored with it. But I have been reluctant to switch to Android because the iPhone is amazing. I've used pixel 7a for a month before this but It had a lot of issues with fingerprint and face id recognition. But after using the Motorola edge 50 pro I might not switch back to the iPhone anytime soon. This is an amazing phone and you get everything compared to a high end premium phone. I'm in love with the display and you should definitely consider it.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: The beautiful beast is here!  Well, Moto has just nailed it. The first impressions are so good.  Beautiful: 1. The phone looks gorgeous in the hand. 2. Its slim and Bezel-less curved display makes it look ultra premium. 3. The back of the phone has got a velvet finish which makes it Scratch proof.  Beast: 1. The battery is insane. It lasted for 1.5 days easily for me with hotspot on and heavy usage. Moreover it charges completely in 30 min with the 125W charger given with the 12gb variant.  2. The performance is as smooth as my girlfriend's skin.  3. The camera details are crazy. Here's Einstein (my dog-baby and TailBlaze co-founder) in the photo. The setting was low-light but the details are crazy. 4. Wireless charging worked pretty smooth in my car and the speaker is insanely loud and clear. 5. Network reception is great too!  I mean this is the best phone I have ever put my hands on in this price range out of the 100 phones I have reviewed.  Kudos to Team Moto!\n",

The setting was low-light but the details are crazy. 4. Wireless charging worked pretty smooth in my car and the speaker is insanely loud and clear. 5. Network reception is great too!  I mean this is the best phone I have ever put my hands on in this price range out of the 100 phones I have reviewed.  Kudos to Team Moto!\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: I'm Giving Honest Review After Using it For more than 8Day .. let meat after 1 month.. I am Mentioning the Cons First.. 1. The Battery is not Efficient for a whole long day you have to charge it twice per day . If u are a normal user and use it on only a4g/lte network then u may use it for whole working day But if u are heavy user u have a charge it minimum 2 times or may be 3 times . It totally depends up to your uses and needs  Pros... But u will get 80/125 watts fqst charging adapter so don't worry it can charge only 40/20 min around .. actually they told 124 whattt charge it will take 19 min but it not true it take around 40 min  2.I noticed it's heating issues... bit don't think it's a Cons Caz I used I phone 12 for photography it is also get heated within 10 minutes of use so don't worry it's a normal  But if u are heavy Using it at outside in the sun or any temperature area then try to avoid it  If u use it for gaming or heavy use then try to sit any cool place like ac room or at least in front af fan then there is no heating issue.....  Some youtuber said if u aren't use tempered glass for the very first day it gets scratches but totally false cons.. 1.battery is not up to the mark 2.turbo charging is good but it will heat your phone too much 3. No official motorola store to buy accessories 4. Camera take few minutes to enhance photo 5. They provided plastic screen guard (film) Do not come with pre installed .  These phone gives u full of features and pro things .. 1. Display quality and brightness is awesome 2.camera is Next level it work with auto enhancement 3.Ram management is perfect . Still not found any choppy or lauggs 4.multitasking and gaming performance is good 5. Ip68 rating give u freedom to use worry free 6. It's comes with Dolby dual speakers sound Quality awesome 7. Most imp network quality it work 5g network Superficialy band is best 8. It's handy phone it will fits any size of hand 9. When it come in hand people noticed awesome feel 10.design is cool.\n",

      "Rating: 3, Review: Having issue with the double back tap option in the phone, it does not work most of the time. Apart from the had few issues with the performance, overall a decent phone. Anyone else having an issue with the double back tap (Quick launch) feature?\n",
      "Rating: 3, Review: The phone gets warm sometimes. Especially after the 1st boot up it got very hot. Also it gets warm when installing any app. Charging drops really fast even when you are playing less cpu/gpu intensive games. Even watching vids will reduce ur battery fast. The phone heating issue is kinda weird, it gets hot sometimes over the smallest of the tasks and sometimes it won't. If u use ur phone very less, the charge will probably stay for 1 or 2 days but that less of a usage is not possible nowadays. Given that Overheating and battery optimisation issues many reviewers are reporting, I hope they are fixable by software updates. It's really annoying that none of the YT reviewers mentioned these issues.\n",

Powerful Performance: The Snapdragon 7 Gen 3 chipset with up to 12GB RAM ensures smooth multitasking and gaming. 3. Impressive Camera System: The 50MP main camera, along with ultrawide and telephoto lenses, captures stunning photos. 4. Battery and Charging: The 4500mAh battery with 125W wired charging provides all-day usage and quick recharges. 5. Room for Improvement: Video recording stability and haptic feedback could have been better. I hope Motorola can fix the video recording part through a software update.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: I had moto edge 20 previously, it is a great update overall. Although moto has done a phenomenal job with the camera this time, they should also keep update cycles in mind this time. Still the camera needs some optimisation, it feels slower during processing of images. Don't step back seeing it's ufs 2.2, it is well optimised and supersedes its competitors. Well built phone for the price point. Although I had one complaint from moto that I didn't get any pre applied scratch guard on the phone, instead a scratch guard was provided in the box for self application, maybe this was a case with my unit only, so moto should address that in future shipments too.\n",

      "Rating: 4, Review: Haven't used the Motorola device for a long time. Using this for a couple of weeks now. Coming from Oneplus 7, I feel performance hasn't really dropped. Camera is definitely an upgrade and the only improvement area would be processing time for photos. Update can fix it. Display and design are top notch considering the price of the device. Haptics could have been better but remember what you are paying. Overall it's a flagship challenging device for sure. Good for daily use, charging speeds are insanely fast. I haven't observed heating issues at all. It just gets warm sometimes. Just hoping for on time software updates from Motorola at least after implementing the New UI. Please note that UFS storage and RAM type for this phone are well optimised and I haven't felt lag at all. I have purchased the moonlight Pearl and it looks standout from the rest of the Mobiles. One more suggestion for Motorola is to roll out some AI features that other brands are doing for better user experience. I will update the review after long term use.\n",

      "Rating: 3, Review: Mobile is Good. But , battery 🔋 optimisation is not good. Because I am not a heavy user, I still charge my mobile minimum 3 times per day. Maybe it' will be solved in the next update.\n",
      "Rating: 4, Review: Here's my Honest Review:  Pros- Phone feels premium, design 5/5. 125W Charging is damn fast. Display is too good 5/5. Audio Quality is next level, as moto is using Dolby Atmos speakers. Camera: Portrait photos are really coming great.  Cons- Phone gets little warm while charging as it is 125W. But not a big deal. Even it's 4500 battery but still it will last you whole day. Photo processing takes 2-3 seconds.  Conclusion:- if you need a flagship experience phone, a complete balanced phone great camera, display, audio, design then just go for it.  But if you are a kid below 20 who plays games alot and don't care about camera, display etc then you buy performance centric phone. But if you need balanced phone then moto edge 50 pro is best.  In summary: moto took best parts of different companies like camera of Sony, LG OLED display, Speakers of Dolby Atmos, combined all and build this phone with moto branding.  My overall Rating is 4.5/5\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: I usually don't write reviews but this phone deserves every praise there is to offer. Phone usually charges within 20-30 mins. And gives a whole day worth of screen time. The curved display is fantastic to touch and watch. Brightness is too good (I use it at 60%) and it's still too bright. The processor is pretty good for gaming and daily usage. UI is pretty good and easy to use. Camera is awesome and preforms better than expectations. Especially the AI zoom... People were surprised when they saw the quality of images and videos this camera delivers. Lastly, the water resistance.... Today I went to WoW Waterpark and took the phone with me in all the rides... Suffice to say not a single issue with the phone and the videos are top notch. Anyone looking to buy a good mid range phone should definitely buy this without giving a second thought. Moto has really outdone itself with this model.\n",

The performance is on par for the segment, and there is absolutely no lag for day to day standard usage. The phone does get warm during some operations, but it is well within the limit.  The only negative is that the curved edge sometimes results in touch related issues. It happens only in some conditions of holding the phone in some specific way, and it's difficult to pinpoint the exact reason.\n",

The charger is a big one, you need to buy an adapter, else it touches the switches.  User interface, need to adjust I was an apple user.  Curved display is a great experience. Flipkart experience is somewhat bad. Due to delay in delivery Many a times. Overall it's good purchase\n",

The 12GB RAM paired with the Snapdragon 7s Gen 2 processor is a fantastic combination, especially in this price segment. This translates to impressive performance for everyday tasks like browsing, social media, and running productivity apps. There's no lag, making it a joy to use for daily activities. Long-Lasting Power (with a Caveat): The 5000mAh battery is a big plus, but some initial optimization might be required to achieve optimal battery life. The good news is that after optimization, you can expect dependable power to last a full day on a single charge. 12GB/256 Storage King: Never worry about running out of space again. The massive 256GB storage allows you to download apps, store photos, and keep videos without worrying about filling it up anytime soon. Capable Camera for Everyday Snaps: The camera system might not boast every high-end feature, but it delivers well for everyday use. The 50MP main sensor captures crisp photos, and the 13MP ultrawide lens is a great addition for capturing expansive scenes. While there's no dedicated telephoto lens for zooming in, the overall camera setup is well-suited for casual photography needs. Stunning Visuals: The 144Hz pOLED display is a true highlight. This display offers a buttery smooth experience, vibrant colors, and makes everything from browsing the web to watching videos a pleasure. Premium Design in Your Hand: The phone's sleek design feels luxurious and is sure to turn heads. It has a premium look and feels that rivals more expensive options. Clean Software Experience: Stock Android 14 keeps things simple and bloatware-free. You'll get a clean interface and the latest updates directly from Google. Beyond Your Observations: Not a Gaming Beast: The Snapdragon 7s Gen 2, while powerful for everyday tasks, might struggle with demanding games at the highest settings. If mobile gaming is a major priority, you might want to consider a phone with a more powerful graphics processor. The Final Verdict: The Moto Edge 50 Fusion (12GB/256GB) is an excellent choice for users seeking a powerful and smooth experience for everyday tasks. It boasts a beautiful display, ample storage, a capable camera, and a long-lasting battery (with some optimization). With its premium design and clean software, this phone offers excellent value for its price segment. If you're a casual gamer and prioritize a phone for everyday use, photos, and entertainment, the Moto Edge 50 Fusion (12GB/256GB) is definitely worth considering.\n",

I took some pictures with its camera, which were a bit saturated but overall the pictures were quite good. Its video quality is the same but its OIS is much better than other phones. Talking about battery backup, after charging I used it throughout the day and it lasted for 8 hours. In the end I would say that its pink variant is very suitable for girls.\n",

Basically u can get flagship and clean software experience .The performance is not up to that mark like flagship but u don't feel any problem in day to day usage .

BATTERY-5/5 I got 7 to 8 hrs of SOT in my heavy usage .Although u can get up to 1.5 to 2 day of Battery backup in moderate usage. U get a 68w charger brick which charge ur phone within 45 m DISPLAY- 5/5 U get a bright and beautiful curve display with GG protection with higher refresh rate of 144 hz  When I got the product it has some bugs and i got an update after 3 days of receiving the product and the bug got fixed . 1-The camera shutter lag has got fixed and fast. 2-Whenever I exit the camera app the auto brightness was not working but after update it got fixed. Many people r bit afraid to buy because of the not giving timely sofware update of moto . But I think they will fix with their new hello moto ui as i got an update after 3 days of receiving the unit Don't think twice just go for it......\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: If anyone is looking for a review of this phone, then he/she can read this post..... or I recommend you'll to watch YouTube reviews for better understanding🫠  Pros : 1. The Motorola Edge 50 Fusion offers a premium design with a glass front, vegan leather back, and IP68 rating. 2. The 6.7-inch pOLED display delivers vibrant colors and a smooth 144Hz refresh rate, protected by Gorilla Glass 5. 3. Powered by the Snapdragon 7s Gen 2 chipset and running Android 14, the phone provides smooth performance for everyday tasks. 4. The triple camera setup, led by a 50MP primary sensor, captures detailed shots in good lighting conditions. 5. With a 5,000mAh battery and 68W fast charging support, the Edge 50 Fusion offers decent battery life and quick top-ups.  Cons: 1. Camera hangs sometimes. 2. Low light photography is not quite good.  Overall, the Motorola Edge 50 Fusion is a well-rounded smartphone that balances features and value, making it a worthy consideration for those seeking a device with a focus on design and display quality.  Highly Recommended...💯\n",

      "Rating: 3, Review: The phone looks good and operates smoothly. The OS is clean Android, the camera is good, and the battery life is strong. However, this is the second Motorola phone I've had, and I'm deducting two stars due to a persistent mic issue. On both phones, my voice gets distorted during calls. I've checked this in different locations, so it's not a signal issue; it's definitely a problem with the mic. Motorola should address this issue.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Good product by Motorola. Only one negative point is that battery drains fastly. Major positives- No bloatwares and unnecessary apps like other companies have. Thin and light weight although it have 5000 mah battery. Water and dust proof. Immersive poled display. fast and responsive processor. Beautiful curved and bezel less display. width is less so easy to grip. Great camera quality with extra punchiness makes pics more attractive. Moto's personalised UI is easy to operate and comes with some new cool features. Fast 68watt charger does the job. It doesn't have it's own gallery and file manager, but u can use Google gallery and Google files. These all things makes it worthy to buy.\n",
      "Rating: 4, Review: Moto has literally it this time with Edge 50 Fusion.  Build Quality and Design - Simplistically ergonomic. Display - The best curved OLED display in this segment hands-down and it makes it very easy to hold the phone. Battery - Astounding battery backup even being used continuously on 5G network and/or WiFi. SOT of 6 hours. Cameras - Brand is listening to us. Both the cameras capture amazing social media ready images. Multimedia - Dolby Atmos makes a big difference. It enhances this phone's capabilities. UI - Hello UI is better than most of the android skins. It is implemented beautifully with enough customization. Performance - Although the processor could have been better, it is still buttery smooth because of the Hello UI. Haptics - It is basic for this price but not a showstopper.\n",

The battery will easily last you for a day and even if it doesn't you can use the fast charger to charge your phone quickly. The display is excellent however I am finding it a little difficult to find a tempered glass because of the curve screen.  Good thing is that there is very little bloatware and you can disable that so you will not get any unnecessary notifications at least that is what I have seen so far. Overall a complete value for money device\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: The photo is a sample , turned on all post processing. The phone seems like a complete package. Very good display, a bit taller. You won't get video of that aspect ratio most the time so can't utilise that much screen when playing video. But it make it more useful in daily task like when typing you will get more screen area for the apps.  Sound is good. Not rating very good. But works fine for the budget. Camera is nice. ( I do have iPhone 13), the photo after post processing is better than iPhone 13. People with s23, iphone are praising the output which is better than their. Front camera is extremely sharp at the hands length which very good for selfie. Wide angle lens has autofocus. It is not as good as main camera. Little bit softer. The images are useful though. Nfc for this budget is good. I can pay at pos machine with that. Felt very convenient. I am not into series gaming now. So can't tell more about the performance. Software is very good. No bugs felt so far after 4 weeks of use. No bloatware as well\n",

Display it is strikingly good at this price. colors are accurate and punchy. The display is of very good quality. you can take it toe to toe with some high end phones.  Design. Although the design is good, it depends on the personal preference. on my usage i find it to be a sleek device and lightweight on your hand.

The colours are punchy and lively. I'm using a 120Hz refresh rate and it's smooth as butter. Edge to edge display is really awesome. If I have to pick one thing about the phone then it's the display.  Camera - 9/10 - I haven't tested the camera a lot but the photos are coming really well.  Battery - 10/10 - No heat at all when charging the phone and it's changing insanely fast. I got a 128 watt charger along with this phone and it goes 0% to 100% in just 20 min. And I'm easily getting one day. I'm a medium-heavy user and I'm getting one day charging easily.  Performance - 9/10 - I got 12GB Ram version and no lags whatsoever. I played a few games and did not see any frame drops or lags. And it's handling high graphic settings like it's nothing.  Design -9/10 - it's very sleek and thin. I got the Lavender colour and I'm in love with it. When you hold it, it feels like a 60k-70k premium phone.  Overall Verdict - I have been an iPhone user for the past few years and I got bored with it. But I have been reluctant to switch to Android because the iPhone is amazing. I've used pixel 7a for a month before this but It had a lot of issues with fingerprint and face id recognition. But after using the Motorola edge 50 pro I might not switch back to the iPhone anytime soon. This is an amazing phone and you get everything compared to a high end premium phone. I'm in love with the display and you should definitely consider it.\n",

      "Rating: 4, Review: Overall very decent product. Great work by Motorola team. Camera, display, design is very good. One can definitely go for buying it. Only observation is while charging with 125 watt charger,phone gets really heated up. Rest is fine. Ask me in case of any query.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: The beautiful beast is here!  Well, Moto has just nailed it. The first impressions are so good.  Beautiful: 1. The phone looks gorgeous in the hand. 2. Its slim and Bezel-less curved display makes it look ultra premium. 3. The back of the phone has got a velvet finish which makes it Scratch proof.  Beast: 1. The battery is insane. It lasted for 1.5 days easily for me with hotspot on and heavy usage. Moreover it charges completely in 30 min with the 125W charger given with the 12gb variant.  2. The performance is as smooth as my girlfriend's skin.  3. The camera details are crazy. Here's Einstein (my dog-baby and TailBlaze co-founder) in the photo. The setting was low-light but the details are crazy. 4. Wireless charging worked pretty smooth in my car and the speaker is insanely loud and clear. 5. Network reception is great too!  I mean this is the best phone I have ever put my hands on in this price range out of the 100 phones I have reviewed.  Kudos to Team Moto!\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: I'm Giving Honest Review After Using it For more than 8Day .. let meat after 1 month.. I am Mentioning the Cons First.. 1. The Battery is not Efficient for a whole long day you have to charge it twice per day . If u are a normal user and use it on only a4g/lte network then u may use it for whole working day But if u are heavy user u have a charge it minimum 2 times or may be 3 times . It totally depends up to your uses and needs  Pros... But u will get 80/125 watts fqst charging adapter so don't worry it can charge only 40/20 min around .. actually they told 124 whattt charge it will take 19 min but it not true it take around 40 min  2.I noticed it's heating issues... bit don't think it's a Cons Caz I used I phone 12 for photography it is also get heated within 10 minutes of use so don't worry it's a normal  But if u are heavy Using it at outside in the sun or any temperature area then try to avoid it  If u use it for gaming or heavy use then try to sit any cool place like ac room or at least in front af fan then there is no heating issue.....  Some youtuber said if u aren't use tempered glass for the very first day it gets scratches but totally false cons.. 1.battery is not up to the mark 2.turbo charging is good but it will heat your phone too much 3. No official motorola store to buy accessories 4. Camera take few minutes to enhance photo 5. They provided plastic screen guard (film) Do not come with pre installed .  These phone gives u full of features and pro things .. 1. Display quality and brightness is awesome 2.camera is Next level it work with auto enhancement 3.Ram management is perfect . Still not found any choppy or lauggs 4.multitasking and gaming performance is good 5. Ip68 rating give u freedom to use worry free 6. It's comes with Dolby dual speakers sound Quality awesome 7. Most imp network quality it work 5g network Superficialy band is best 8. It's handy phone it will fits any size of hand 9. When it come in hand people noticed awesome feel 10.design is cool.\n",

      "Rating: 3, Review: Having issue with the double back tap option in the phone, it does not work most of the time. Apart from the had few issues with the performance, overall a decent phone. Anyone else having an issue with the double back tap (Quick launch) feature?\n",
      "Rating: 3, Review: The phone gets warm sometimes. Especially after the 1st boot up it got very hot. Also it gets warm when installing any app. Charging drops really fast even when you are playing less cpu/gpu intensive games. Even watching vids will reduce ur battery fast. The phone heating issue is kinda weird, it gets hot sometimes over the smallest of the tasks and sometimes it won't. If u use ur phone very less, the charge will probably stay for 1 or 2 days but that less of a usage is not possible nowadays. Given that Overheating and battery optimisation issues many reviewers are reporting, I hope they are fixable by software updates. It's really annoying that none of the YT reviewers mentioned these issues.\n",

Powerful Performance: The Snapdragon 7 Gen 3 chipset with up to 12GB RAM ensures smooth multitasking and gaming. 3. Impressive Camera System: The 50MP main camera, along with ultrawide and telephoto lenses, captures stunning photos. 4. Battery and Charging: The 4500mAh battery with 125W wired charging provides all-day usage and quick recharges. 5. Room for Improvement: Video recording stability and haptic feedback could have been better. I hope Motorola can fix the video recording part through a software update.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: I had moto edge 20 previously, it is a great update overall. Although moto has done a phenomenal job with the camera this time, they should also keep update cycles in mind this time. Still the camera needs some optimisation, it feels slower during processing of images. Don't step back seeing it's ufs 2.2, it is well optimised and supersedes its competitors. Well built phone for the price point. Although I had one complaint from moto that I didn't get any pre applied scratch guard on the phone, instead a scratch guard was provided in the box for self application, maybe this was a case with my unit only, so moto should address that in future shipments too.\n",

      "Rating: 4, Review: Haven't used the Motorola device for a long time. Using this for a couple of weeks now. Coming from Oneplus 7, I feel performance hasn't really dropped. Camera is definitely an upgrade and the only improvement area would be processing time for photos. Update can fix it. Display and design are top notch considering the price of the device. Haptics could have been better but remember what you are paying. Overall it's a flagship challenging device for sure. Good for daily use, charging speeds are insanely fast. I haven't observed heating issues at all. It just gets warm sometimes. Just hoping for on time software updates from Motorola at least after implementing the New UI. Please note that UFS storage and RAM type for this phone are well optimised and I haven't felt lag at all. I have purchased the moonlight Pearl and it looks standout from the rest of the Mobiles. One more suggestion for Motorola is to roll out some AI features that other brands are doing for better user experience. I will update the review after long term use.\n",

      "Rating: 3, Review: Mobile is Good. But , battery 🔋 optimisation is not good. Because I am not a heavy user, I still charge my mobile minimum 3 times per day. Maybe it' will be solved in the next update.\n",
      "Rating: 4, Review: Here's my Honest Review:  Pros- Phone feels premium, design 5/5. 125W Charging is damn fast. Display is too good 5/5. Audio Quality is next level, as moto is using Dolby Atmos speakers. Camera: Portrait photos are really coming great.  Cons- Phone gets little warm while charging as it is 125W. But not a big deal. Even it's 4500 battery but still it will last you whole day. Photo processing takes 2-3 seconds.  Conclusion:- if you need a flagship experience phone, a complete balanced phone great camera, display, audio, design then just go for it.  But if you are a kid below 20 who plays games alot and don't care about camera, display etc then you buy performance centric phone. But if you need balanced phone then moto edge 50 pro is best.  In summary: moto took best parts of different companies like camera of Sony, LG OLED display, Speakers of Dolby Atmos, combined all and build this phone with moto branding.  My overall Rating is 4.5/5\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: I usually don't write reviews but this phone deserves every praise there is to offer. Phone usually charges within 20-30 mins. And gives a whole day worth of screen time. The curved display is fantastic to touch and watch. Brightness is too good (I use it at 60%) and it's still too bright. The processor is pretty good for gaming and daily usage. UI is pretty good and easy to use. Camera is awesome and preforms better than expectations. Especially the AI zoom... People were surprised when they saw the quality of images and videos this camera delivers. Lastly, the water resistance.... Today I went to WoW Waterpark and took the phone with me in all the rides... Suffice to say not a single issue with the phone and the videos are top notch. Anyone looking to buy a good mid range phone should definitely buy this without giving a second thought. Moto has really outdone itself with this model.\n",

The performance is on par for the segment, and there is absolutely no lag for day to day standard usage. The phone does get warm during some operations, but it is well within the limit.  The only negative is that the curved edge sometimes results in touch related issues. It happens only in some conditions of holding the phone in some specific way, and it's difficult to pinpoint the exact reason.\n",

The charger is a big one, you need to buy an adapter, else it touches the switches.  User interface, need to adjust I was an apple user.  Curved display is a great experience. Flipkart experience is somewhat bad. Due to delay in delivery Many a times. Overall it's good purchase\n",

      "Rating: 4, Review: My Honest Review (after using it for more than a week) 1) Display: Before buying this phone I had realme x7 Max which had amoled fhd+ display with 409 PPI and this phone has 393 PPI so I can spot the difference in the sharpness and quality which I missed out during my reasearch. The rest aspects of display are good. 2) Camera: Again, my old phone had 64mp rear so I could see better details after zooming in the clicked picture or live 4k video compared to this phone. But, this phone has good after processing functionality so it might be a bit satisfactory. 3) Software: By far it's good. Did not feel jittery anywhere apart from camera app opening and closing times but it's rare. 4) Battery: I never charge my phone to 100%. I always charge it within the 35-85% range which will help to prolong the life and I'm not a heavy user so I can easily get 5.30 hours of sot before the next charge which roughly takes about 15-20 minutes. And, also I didn't enable the Charge boost to avoid overheating the battery while charging. So, this department is great. 5) others: Didn't face any calling issues, even wifi calling experience is good. Difficulty in finding the right case for the phone to ensure the safety so need to use it carefully. Idle drain 3% at night at 120hz RR, 4%-5% at night at 144hz RR.\n",

The phone is super lightweight, making it easy to carry around without feeling bulky.  One of the standout features for me is the quick charging capability. It saves me so much time and keeps me going throughout the day without constantly worrying about battery life. Another big plus is the absence of bloatware, which means a cleaner and smoother user experience.  The 5G connectivity is top-notch, providing fast and reliable internet speeds. Overall, it's a fantastic phone with great features. The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is that there's always room for a bit of improvement. Highly recommended!\n",

      "Rating: 4, Review: My Honest Review (after using it for more than a week) 1) Display: Before buying this phone I had realme x7 Max which had amoled fhd+ display with 409 PPI and this phone has 393 PPI so I can spot the difference in the sharpness and quality which I missed out during my reasearch. The rest aspects of display are good. 2) Camera: Again, my old phone had 64mp rear so I could see better details after zooming in the clicked picture or live 4k video compared to this phone. But, this phone has good after processing functionality so it might be a bit satisfactory. 3) Software: By far it's good. Did not feel jittery anywhere apart from camera app opening and closing times but it's rare. 4) Battery: I never charge my phone to 100%. I always charge it within the 35-85% range which will help to prolong the life and I'm not a heavy user so I can easily get 5.30 hours of sot before the next charge which roughly takes about 15-20 minutes. And, also I didn't enable the Charge boost to avoid overheating the battery while charging. So, this department is great. 5) others: Didn't face any calling issues, even wifi calling experience is good. Difficulty in finding the right case for the phone to ensure the safety so need to use it carefully. Idle drain 3% at night at 120hz RR, 4%-5% at night at 144hz RR.\n",

      "Product Name: Motorola Edge 50 Neo (PANTONE Grisaille, 256 GB)  (8 GB RAM)\n",
      "Product Price: ₹25,999\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: I ordered this phone due to a sudden issue with my old Poco X2. After 4.5 years of using other brands, it's great to be back with Motorola. The Moto Edge 50 Neo isn't for typical users who want a bigger battery, display, and performance. Instead, it's perfect for those who prefer a compact, one-handed phone with a great display and smooth functionality. It's not designed for gamers but suits those who appreciate a compact design with good performance. Thanks to Motorola for offering such a compact phone, saving me from spending a lot on a Google Pixel or Samsung S24.  **Pros:** 1. Fantastic design and build quality 2. Great display for this price range (almost as good as any flagship phone display) 3. Cameras have exceeded expectations 4. Clean software experience with the Hello UI 5. Good network reception and stable WiFi 6. Convenient size for one-handed use 7. Crystal clear sound quality 8. Good haptics  **Cons:** 1. Battery capacity and drain are common complaints. Initially, the battery drain is high for the first three days. However, the Edge 50 Neo uses AI to learn your usage patterns and optimizes battery drain, providing an average one-day battery life after optimization. The LTPO display also helps save battery.  2. Software update: well on paper Motorola promises 5 years of android and security patch updates. That's huge right! But going by the track records of Motorola software updates, updates were not frequent and sometimes not delivered at all. So I'm little bit sceptical about the software update promise. Let's see how Moto would keep it's promise.  Overall, the Motorola Edge 50 Neo is a unique smartphone targeting users who love compact phones with good performance and a clean software experience at a lower cost. If that sounds like you, it's definitely worth considering.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: This feels really very premium Quality is good at this price point along with 5 years update. The camera is quite good as it offers 3X optical zoom Touch and finish feels premium Charging speed is Really fast with a 68 watt charger Moto gestures are a big Plus It's like an iphone of the Android offering a 5 year update.  Must buy if You are looking for an all rounder phone\n",
      "Rating: 4, Review: Yes battery drain fast, but I was looking for compact device and Samsung was out of my range, so purchased this. Please make smaller devices, between 5.5 to 6 inch devices.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: MUST KNOW BEFORE BUYING THIS PHONE--- 1. DON'T BUY if you are a GAMER, REEL ADDICT OR DOOM SCROLLER. 2. MUST BUY if you want DURABLE LONG LASTING SIMPLE COMPACT PHONE WHICH GETS THE JOB DONE.  Mind it- This phone doesn't have Greatest processor or battery, But It's built like a TANK and It's Camera Hardware is Very GOOD. Software processing needs to be FIXED. Battery lasts a Day if you use your phone like a tool it is and not like an addict. Hope it helps.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: I will write the review after a few days of usage.  Till then, the phone is not heating a lot, you will face a little trouble in finding the display tempered glass as the phone is too short and new.  Overall good but the transferring speed of data in UFS 2.2 seems a little slow but you will not feel anything in day to day usage.  Overall a Good Phone you can check, Next I will edit this after 7 days of usage  *Writing after 7 Days of usage*  Phone Display is too Good So the Speaker, you may feel little vibration but it is manageable, I have got 2 software within 7 days of purchase  Must add tempered glass to your list, the Glass is Gorila 3 you may notice a few scratches.  The only problem is the laggy camera in Photo mode. Although it is manageable, why. I hope moto will Fix this in the upcoming software update.  The battery is also not so bad I am a medium user it easily provides me 1Day Backup easily with about 6.2-6.3hr of SOT, and if I play game and do video records it gives around 5.5 to 5.7hr SOT\n",

The sleek design and vibrant display make for a stunning visual experience, while the performance is incredibly smooth, handling all apps and games effortlessly. The camera quality is fantastic, capturing sharp and vivid photos even in low light. Battery life is impressive, lasting through a full day of heavy use. I also love the clean Android experience without any bloatware. Overall, this phone offers amazing value for its price, and I highly recommend it!\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: Ditched my decision of buying edge 50 fusion at the last minute and went with this. It's a wonderful phone. Performance is good for some one who does routine tasks and not into extreme gaming( though I had no issue with playing PUBg)  Pros: ----- 1. Design and look and color 2. Great Display 3. Small and light form factor 4. Camera 5. OS and Moto AI especially AI generated wallpaper 6. Performance 7. No heating  Cons: ------ 1. Small battery 2. No audio jack  Also was confused between Poinciana and Latte color and trust me Latte is too good in real. Glad I didn't make the wrong choice\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Good product moto nice work 💯💯\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: This phone is a perfect compact sized mid ranger for daily tasking n multi media etc (don't consider it specifically for gaming) overall a very balanced phone until now .  The in hand feel is very premium , the phone is light and fits very well in the hand because of its 6.3in compact display.  Moto's hello UI is very clean and smooth , with lots of features n customisations feels very premium.  Battery life , considering the 4310mah battery is very optimised and can easily last up to 8-9 hrs with moderate usage .  Phone's selfie camera is not so good as it generates very punchy skin colours (yellowish) and makes the tongue very (pinkish) but details are fine . On the other hand the rear camera is great , photos turn out very sharp and close to natural colour .  The media output is very good and loud , Dolby Atmos makes it balanced and sharp .  Remember moto phones don't have their own gallery app all the photos are stored in Google photos , not a big deal .  I can't say much about gaming as I haven't tried any heavy gaming as such ! But yaa a MD7300 processor is capable for decent gaming performance.  Hope moto keeps their promise of their timely OS and security updates . Overall a great phone for normal daily tasking, very smooth very fast !\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: If you are looking for a compact phone with good cameras and decent performance and stock android without any ads this phone is for you.  Pros 1.display is really impressive with 1.5k 120 hz ltpo and bezels are so thin 2. Design is very eye pleadings with vegan leather and it is so comfortable to hold 3.battery backup is actually good( I was expecting worse) i got sot 6-7hrs with moderate usage (refresh rate at auto). 4.camera is really good in this price range with 3x telephoto I am addicted using it. Videos comes out really good with no jitters and shaking. 5.ui experience is really good too with no ads and bloatwares and also so many moto features. In this phone always on display is present which is not even in the edge 50 ultra( it will not turn off after few seconds like the midrange phones thanks to ltpo display). Cons 1. Camera app is a little bit jerky needs some optimization from moto. But it is not like complete useless. Skin tone are a bit reddish when light is low but it can be fixed. Gcam works fine 2. There is no lag while gaming. Cod supports 90fps But batter will drain fast like 20% in 1 hr so I will not recommend for gaming. But with casual gaming it is fine  Over all it is the best phone under 25k if this is your type phone\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: All rounder phone. I wish the battery was 4500, but that's fine no phone is perfect at all. Cameras are all usable and great. Not like other brands giving useless cameras. But sometimes I feel the photos are over saturated. Awesome display. And the smart connect feature is damn useful and great. The back cover is good quality. And the leather is smelling very nice and sweet. And I chose this phone over edge 50 and edge 50 fusion just because of its flat display. In short if you need a good phone with better software and clean android like features, not going to play many games, good camera and a good display and afterall compact phone this is the best choice in this segment.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: Here's a review based on experience:   *Motorola Edge 50 Neo Review: A Solid Performer  Rating: 4.5/5  I've spent 24 hours with the Motorola Edge 50 Neo, and here's my initial impression:   *Pros:*  1. *Decent Design*: The phone looks sleek and premium, with a comfortable grip. 2. *Impressive Camera*: The camera performance is impressive, capturing crisp and detailed photos. 3. *Smooth Performance*: The device handles everyday tasks seamlessly, with no noticeable lag. 4. *Feature-Packed*: Comes with WiFi 6, Bluetooth 5.2, and other modern connectivity options.   *Cons:*  1. *Battery Life*: Battery drain is relatively fast; 24 hours of moderate use (WiFi on, calls, and general usage) saw the battery drop to 40%. 2. *No Exceptional Features*: While it's a solid device, it lacks a standout feature to differentiate it from competitors.   *Verdict:*  The Motorola Edge 50 Neo is a reliable smartphone with good performance, camera quality, and design. However, battery life could be better. If you're looking for a device that checks all the boxes without breaking the bank, this might be a good option.   *Recommendation:*  For those who prioritize battery life, consider exploring other options. However, if you're willing to compromise on battery life for a well-rounded device, the Motorola Edge 50 Neo is worth considering.   *Rating Breakdown:*  - Design: 4/5 - Camera: 4.5/5 - Performance: 4.5/5 - Battery Life: 4.5/5 - Value for Money: 4.5/5\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: This review after using 7 days.  In many reviews, I saw many people saying the camera is not good. But after usage, I can say the camera is not so bad, it's very good, both front and back. Obviously you can't expect a DSLR like photography. It's a phone not a DSLR .  Battery backup with fast charging facility is very good. And RAM optimisation is amazing. It goes full day in moderate usage. If gaming then you should charge twice daily which is quite obvious. And this phone is not for hardcore gaming, if you want hardcore gaming, then purchase a gaming phone.  The display quality is just amazing and superb.  The size of the phone is quite handy and has a nice grip feeling to hold the leather back.  There is no heating issue found.  Conclusion : This is the must buy phone in 2024. Go for it without any hesitation. 😊❤️\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Best segment phone with great cameras and performance. I've been using this for a week now.  It has really good cameras, with good performance. The battery performs well and gives a full day on a single charge. It also takes around 40 mins to charge full. It feels very snappy and the display is really good. The size is also very comfortable. Thanks to it's compact size.  The only cons that I feel about this phone is the camera app. It stutters a lot. I felt while taking pictures. Maybe, if Motorola starts giving timely updates or an update might fix this issue. Rest, everything felt great. Also comes in a great price.  Overall, if you're looking for a great phone with good cameras, good IP rating, compact phone with the best display, military grade certified with 5 years of major android and security updates, this phone is a banger! A must buy. 🔥💯❤️\n",

A hard case is included in the box, a soft case would have been a better option.  Display looks crisp. Camera is decent.

      "Rating: 5, Review: I have been looking for a perfect phone since a long and had done enough research and was confused between two but finally I went for this and trust me, this is one of the best decision I took. Flipkart delivery was fast.  - Coming to phone yes it has smaller battery and as per everyone I had same concern but moto has done a great optimization and till now I completed 8 to 10 cycle and every time I got more than 6 hours of Screen on time with moderate usage.  - Camera is mind-boggling, performance is also pretty good, although it's not gaming phone but I'm casual gamer and it can smoothly run couple of hours gaming without noticeable lag.  - Due to 1.5k resolution and 6.4 inches display, around 460 ppi with this display will look so clear even brightness is very high to use outdoor without any visibility issues, did not observe any Screen flickering in dark mode and low brightness.  - 5 years Android updates are something amazing, hopefully moto will stay on their words 😄  -Charging is pretty fast 10 minutes will give around 25% of juice, yes phone will get slightly warm during Charging but that's normal with any fast charging.  - Not to forget IP 68 and toughness of Mil grade, it's not just on paper, tried it and it's pretty sturdy build  Display 10/10 Camera 10/10 Battery 8/10 Performance 8.5/10 Build and color 11/10\n",

      "Rating: 4, Review: Here are Pros and Cons :  PROS: 1. Extremely light weight and compact phone. Its too good to be true! 2. Superb display and brightness. A bit saturated but you can tweak them at settings. 3. Fluid and clean UI with no unwanted blotwares. 4. Fast charging and wirless charging with charger and phone case in the box itself 5. Superb sound (though its a bit flat, its loud) 6. Battery backup is good. Keep black wallpaper, black UI and refresh rate at auto.  CONS : 1. Heatsup a bit 2. Camera UI is buggy and also colors are saturated. Also, the gallery takes 2 sec to process the image. 3. This is a con with all motorola phones : No call recorder app, no gallery, no myfiles, no music player,no app lock etc. It was really frustrating for me as my previous phone was samsung and it had all of these by default. These are basic apps and its a shame that motorola is not providing these. 4. Service centeres are not available everywhere. Please check whether your city has before you buy it. 5. Have to see whether motorola fulfills thier update promises as their update history has generally not been good.\n",

Even the camera set-up although perfect, lags due to processor. In 23-24k price range, battery and processor are major flaws  Design and form factor is something you don't find elsewhere. So if your priority is good looking camera Phone which can be single handedly used, go for it. Performance seekers pls avoid it\n",

      "Rating: 4, Review: Great value-for-money phone. Compact size, light-weight, great battery life because of the LTPO displays. Charging is fast enough for me. Great photos too. Videos are okay. I hope they do indeed give 5 years of updates. Even if they don't, this is good for at least 2-2.5 years. RAM management is top notch. Software does have minor lags and stutter but nothing more than a few milliseconds. Go for it, if you're a regular user.\n",

      "Rating: 4, Review: Initially was thinking of buying Nothing phone 2A from which I shifted to this one since Nothing felt quite bulky in hands for me. The phone feels premium and compact in hands. Had shifted to this device from RM 2 Pro. I'm a normal user without gaming. With Dual SIMs and mobile data and the device lasts a day leaving 15- 20% end of the day. The Camera is good in this price bucket and the telephoto lens is an advantage for good captures. Moto should provide an App cloning and lock feature in the UI apart from the Secure Folder feature.\n",

IP 65 and great build quality 5. Decent cameras  Cons: 1. Camera app does not load quickly. Not sure if it's a bug but it takes too long to launch camera. 2. The processor is average. I don't play games but even while processing photos it takes a couple of seconds to prepare the final image.  Overall a decent all round phone which handles your daily tasks pretty neat.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: Form factor:- Phone is slim. Sleek and good to hold.  Display:- display is good.. has dark blacks, good contrast.. and good to look at.  Speaker:- it's louder than my samsung phone.. though I feel vibration at display at full volume.  Camera:- it's good for potrait shots.. camera quality is good for the price.  OS/UI:- clean OS.. with lots of features.. Seamless integration with windows laptop .. really happy with that..  Network: only Airtel 5G does not work.. a big drawback.. other 5G are fine.. wifi and bluetooth are okay too.  Storage: even though ufs 2.2 but speed is good. Better than lot of ufs 3.1..  Battery:- I m writing this review after 12 hrs of not plugged into the charger.. still left with around 50% battery  Charging. 15w wireless.. 68w wired.  Overall a very good phone for this price. Happy with clean OS and overall good phone.\n",

      "Rating: 4, Review: Writing a review after using it for more than a week.  1. In the current situation, we are having a bigger lag issue in camera opening to capture any photo. I am not sure if there will be a future sw update for the same.  2. I was not expecting that there will be some hang issue which is still there on the phone.  3. Battery performance is ok and i am able to run it for one day including my office emails, calls etc.  4. Screen resolutions and its display is very good and i like the performance of this one.  5. The sound quality i did not like as of now and not feeling for anything of Dolby sound, might be some software update will fix this.  6. Another issue found today which is related to heating when i have used the camera for a long time to capture photos for a long time in a party. And also due to the heat camera app was getting off itself.  7. The touch is very smooth in operating this phone.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: After purchasing this phone, you will truly appreciate its value. At this price point, it offers everything you need. The display is exceptional, and with Gorilla Glass protection, you won't have to worry about durability. The phone's design is both premium and slim, providing a great in-hand feel making it seem like you're holding a high-end device. The camera is outstanding for this price range, with the ability to capture stunning portraits using the 3x telephoto lens (85mm), and the 3x zoom on the normal camera delivers superb photo quality. Performance is also strong, thanks to the Snapdragon 7 Gen 1 processor.  Issues (These can be addressed in future software updates): - The camera app takes a significant amount of time to open. - Photo processing time is longer than expected after capturing an image. - Battery optimisation needs improvement, as there is a noticeable battery drain even when the screen is off.\n",

      "Rating: 4, Review: The camera is mind-blowing. I just shared an image of moon with 30x hand held...the result is beyond my expectations.. battery has improved a lot after 3 weeks of use...camera lags sometimes , so you need patience... otherwise it's brilliant...app installing time is very less too...But I have personally found some cons that no one mentioned and that is pretty much important for me. 1. Spot colour image and video : G85 with price 18k has these two feature in camera, edge 50 fusion and pro both have these features. But out of nowhere moto decided to omit these from edge 50.😑😑 2. Battery capacity could have been a little more optimized, although improved after 3 weeks of use. 3. No Always on Display despite thousands of users ' continuous request.😔😔 4. At the beginning haptic vibration was feeling off after using samsung device, but set the vibration level to low to cope up with this , at least it helped me. No major heating issue, i am not gamer. Warms up while using camera, jittery camera operation, otherwise it's fine.\n",

Drawbacks:- Heating issue while using a camera for a bit longer, which is quite easy to understand with this much quality as well as while charging because it has an ultra charging system so it's also acceptable.  Conclusion - Don't delay in going for it, if you are looking up this budget...\n",

      "Rating: 4, Review: First time using a Motorola phone and my experience has been good so far. Switched from Asus Zenfone 5Z which is a great phone and after extensive research decided with Moto Edge 50. Pros: 1. Fantastic display 2. Moto UI 3. Stock android and no ads, bloatware 4. IP 65 and great build quality 5. Decent cameras  Cons: 1. Camera app does not load quickly. Not sure if it's a bug but it takes too long to launch camera. 2. The processor is average. I don't play games but even while processing photos it takes a couple of seconds to prepare the final image.  Overall a decent all round phone which handles your daily tasks pretty neat.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: Form factor:- Phone is slim. Sleek and good to hold.  Display:- display is good.. has dark blacks, good contrast.. and good to look at.  Speaker:- it's louder than my samsung phone.. though I feel vibration at display at full volume.  Camera:- it's good for potrait shots.. camera quality is good for the price.  OS/UI:- clean OS.. with lots of features.. Seamless integration with windows laptop .. really happy with that..  Network: only Airtel 5G does not work.. a big drawback.. other 5G are fine.. wifi and bluetooth are okay too.  Storage: even though ufs 2.2 but speed is good. Better than lot of ufs 3.1..  Battery:- I m writing this review after 12 hrs of not plugged into the charger.. still left with around 50% battery  Charging. 15w wireless.. 68w wired.  Overall a very good phone for this price. Happy with clean OS and overall good phone.\n",

      "Rating: 4, Review: Writing a review after using it for more than a week.  1. In the current situation, we are having a bigger lag issue in camera opening to capture any photo. I am not sure if there will be a future sw update for the same.  2. I was not expecting that there will be some hang issue which is still there on the phone.  3. Battery performance is ok and i am able to run it for one day including my office emails, calls etc.  4. Screen resolutions and its display is very good and i like the performance of this one.  5. The sound quality i did not like as of now and not feeling for anything of Dolby sound, might be some software update will fix this.  6. Another issue found today which is related to heating when i have used the camera for a long time to capture photos for a long time in a party. And also due to the heat camera app was getting off itself.  7. The touch is very smooth in operating this phone.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: After purchasing this phone, you will truly appreciate its value. At this price point, it offers everything you need. The display is exceptional, and with Gorilla Glass protection, you won't have to worry about durability. The phone's design is both premium and slim, providing a great in-hand feel making it seem like you're holding a high-end device. The camera is outstanding for this price range, with the ability to capture stunning portraits using the 3x telephoto lens (85mm), and the 3x zoom on the normal camera delivers superb photo quality. Performance is also strong, thanks to the Snapdragon 7 Gen 1 processor.  Issues (These can be addressed in future software updates): - The camera app takes a significant amount of time to open. - Photo processing time is longer than expected after capturing an image. - Battery optimisation needs improvement, as there is a noticeable battery drain even when the screen is off.\n",

      "Rating: 4, Review: The camera is mind-blowing. I just shared an image of moon with 30x hand held...the result is beyond my expectations.. battery has improved a lot after 3 weeks of use...camera lags sometimes , so you need patience... otherwise it's brilliant...app installing time is very less too...But I have personally found some cons that no one mentioned and that is pretty much important for me. 1. Spot colour image and video : G85 with price 18k has these two feature in camera, edge 50 fusion and pro both have these features. But out of nowhere moto decided to omit these from edge 50.😑😑 2. Battery capacity could have been a little more optimized, although improved after 3 weeks of use. 3. No Always on Display despite thousands of users ' continuous request.😔😔 4. At the beginning haptic vibration was feeling off after using samsung device, but set the vibration level to low to cope up with this , at least it helped me. No major heating issue, i am not gamer. Warms up while using camera, jittery camera operation, otherwise it's fine.\n",

Drawbacks:- Heating issue while using a camera for a bit longer, which is quite easy to understand with this much quality as well as while charging because it has an ultra charging system so it's also acceptable.  Conclusion - Don't delay in going for it, if you are looking up this budget...\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Do not believe the negative reviews. This is an amazing phone. I've switched from iPhone 11 and I'm in love with this already. I also got iPhone 14 plus for my wife but believe me this is much better than iPhone interms of display.  Display - 10/10 - The display is awesome. Crystal clear 1.5k resolution. The colours are punchy and lively. I'm using a 120Hz refresh rate and it's smooth as butter. Edge to edge display is really awesome. If I have to pick one thing about the phone then it's the display.  Camera - 9/10 - I haven't tested the camera a lot but the photos are coming really well.  Battery - 10/10 - No heat at all when charging the phone and it's changing insanely fast. I got a 128 watt charger along with this phone and it goes 0% to 100% in just 20 min. And I'm easily getting one day. I'm a medium-heavy user and I'm getting one day charging easily.  Performance - 9/10 - I got 12GB Ram version and no lags whatsoever. I played a few games and did not see any frame drops or lags. And it's handling high graphic settings like it's nothing.  Design -9/10 - it's very sleek and thin. I got the Lavender colour and I'm in love with it. When you hold it, it feels like a 60k-70k premium phone.  Overall Verdict - I have been an iPhone user for the past few years and I got bored with it. But I have been reluctant to switch to Android because the iPhone is amazing. I've used pixel 7a for a month before this but It had a lot of issues with fingerprint and face id recognition. But after using the Motorola edge 50 pro I might not switch back to the iPhone anytime soon. This is an amazing phone and you get everything compared to a high end premium phone. I'm in love with the display and you should definitely consider it.\n",

Its slim and Bezel-less curved display makes it look ultra premium. 3. The back of the phone has got a velvet finish which makes it Scratch proof.  Beast: 1. The battery is insane. It lasted for 1.5 days easily for me with hotspot on and heavy usage. Moreover it charges completely in 30 min with the 125W charger given with the 12gb variant.  2. The performance is as smooth as my girlfriend's skin.  3. The camera details are crazy. Here's Einstein (my dog-baby and TailBlaze co-founder) in the photo. The setting was low-light but the details are crazy. 4. Wireless charging worked pretty smooth in my car and the speaker is insanely loud and clear. 5. Network reception is great too!

      "Rating: 5, Review: I'm Giving Honest Review After Using it For more than 8Day .. let meat after 1 month.. I am Mentioning the Cons First.. 1. The Battery is not Efficient for a whole long day you have to charge it twice per day . If u are a normal user and use it on only a4g/lte network then u may use it for whole working day But if u are heavy user u have a charge it minimum 2 times or may be 3 times . It totally depends up to your uses and needs  Pros... But u will get 80/125 watts fqst charging adapter so don't worry it can charge only 40/20 min around .. actually they told 124 whattt charge it will take 19 min but it not true it take around 40 min  2.I noticed it's heating issues... bit don't think it's a Cons Caz I used I phone 12 for photography it is also get heated within 10 minutes of use so don't worry it's a normal  But if u are heavy Using it at outside in the sun or any temperature area then try to avoid it  If u use it for gaming or heavy use then try to sit any cool place like ac room or at least in front af fan then there is no heating issue.....  Some youtuber said if u aren't use tempered glass for the very first day it gets scratches but totally false cons.. 1.battery is not up to the mark 2.turbo charging is good but it will heat your phone too much 3. No official motorola store to buy accessories 4. Camera take few minutes to enhance photo 5. They provided plastic screen guard (film) Do not come with pre installed .  These phone gives u full of features and pro things .. 1. Display quality and brightness is awesome 2.camera is Next level it work with auto enhancement 3.Ram management is perfect . Still not found any choppy or lauggs 4.multitasking and gaming performance is good 5. Ip68 rating give u freedom to use worry free 6. It's comes with Dolby dual speakers sound Quality awesome 7. Most imp network quality it work 5g network Superficialy band is best 8. It's handy phone it will fits any size of hand 9. When it come in hand people noticed awesome feel 10.design is cool.\n",

      "Rating: 3, Review: The phone gets warm sometimes. Especially after the 1st boot up it got very hot. Also it gets warm when installing any app. Charging drops really fast even when you are playing less cpu/gpu intensive games. Even watching vids will reduce ur battery fast. The phone heating issue is kinda weird, it gets hot sometimes over the smallest of the tasks and sometimes it won't. If u use ur phone very less, the charge will probably stay for 1 or 2 days but that less of a usage is not possible nowadays. Given that Overheating and battery optimisation issues many reviewers are reporting, I hope they are fixable by software updates. It's really annoying that none of the YT reviewers mentioned these issues.\n",

      "Rating: 4, Review: Point-wise review for the Motorola Edge 50 Pro:  1. Stunning Display: The 6.7-inch P-OLED display offers vibrant colors and crisp details. 2. Powerful Performance: The Snapdragon 7 Gen 3 chipset with up to 12GB RAM ensures smooth multitasking and gaming. 3. Impressive Camera System: The 50MP main camera, along with ultrawide and telephoto lenses, captures stunning photos. 4. Battery and Charging: The 4500mAh battery with 125W wired charging provides all-day usage and quick recharges. 5. Room for Improvement: Video recording stability and haptic feedback could have been better. I hope Motorola can fix the video recording part through a software update.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: I had moto edge 20 previously, it is a great update overall. Although moto has done a phenomenal job with the camera this time, they should also keep update cycles in mind this time. Still the camera needs some optimisation, it feels slower during processing of images. Don't step back seeing it's ufs 2.2, it is well optimised and supersedes its competitors. Well built phone for the price point. Although I had one complaint from moto that I didn't get any pre applied scratch guard on the phone, instead a scratch guard was provided in the box for self application, maybe this was a case with my unit only, so moto should address that in future shipments too.\n",

      "Rating: 4, Review: Haven't used the Motorola device for a long time. Using this for a couple of weeks now. Coming from Oneplus 7, I feel performance hasn't really dropped. Camera is definitely an upgrade and the only improvement area would be processing time for photos. Update can fix it. Display and design are top notch considering the price of the device. Haptics could have been better but remember what you are paying. Overall it's a flagship challenging device for sure. Good for daily use, charging speeds are insanely fast. I haven't observed heating issues at all. It just gets warm sometimes. Just hoping for on time software updates from Motorola at least after implementing the New UI. Please note that UFS storage and RAM type for this phone are well optimised and I haven't felt lag at all. I have purchased the moonlight Pearl and it looks standout from the rest of the Mobiles. One more suggestion for Motorola is to roll out some AI features that other brands are doing for better user experience. I will update the review after long term use.\n",

      "Rating: 3, Review: Mobile is Good. But , battery 🔋 optimisation is not good. Because I am not a heavy user, I still charge my mobile minimum 3 times per day. Maybe it' will be solved in the next update.\n",
      "Rating: 4, Review: Here's my Honest Review:  Pros- Phone feels premium, design 5/5. 125W Charging is damn fast. Display is too good 5/5. Audio Quality is next level, as moto is using Dolby Atmos speakers. Camera: Portrait photos are really coming great.  Cons- Phone gets little warm while charging as it is 125W. But not a big deal. Even it's 4500 battery but still it will last you whole day. Photo processing takes 2-3 seconds.  Conclusion:- if you need a flagship experience phone, a complete balanced phone great camera, display, audio, design then just go for it.  But if you are a kid below 20 who plays games alot and don't care about camera, display etc then you buy performance centric phone. But if you need balanced phone then moto edge 50 pro is best.  In summary: moto took best parts of different companies like camera of Sony, LG OLED display, Speakers of Dolby Atmos, combined all and build this phone with moto branding.  My overall Rating is 4.5/5\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: I usually don't write reviews but this phone deserves every praise there is to offer. Phone usually charges within 20-30 mins. And gives a whole day worth of screen time. The curved display is fantastic to touch and watch. Brightness is too good (I use it at 60%) and it's still too bright. The processor is pretty good for gaming and daily usage. UI is pretty good and easy to use. Camera is awesome and preforms better than expectations. Especially the AI zoom... People were surprised when they saw the quality of images and videos this camera delivers. Lastly, the water resistance.... Today I went to WoW Waterpark and took the phone with me in all the rides... Suffice to say not a single issue with the phone and the videos are top notch. Anyone looking to buy a good mid range phone should definitely buy this without giving a second thought. Moto has really outdone itself with this model.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Excellent phone for this price range.  The camera is very good, and the OLED screen is just amazing. Charge goes from 5% to 80% in less than 15 minutes. The performance is on par for the segment, and there is absolutely no lag for day to day standard usage. The phone does get warm during some operations, but it is well within the limit.  The only negative is that the curved edge sometimes results in touch related issues. It happens only in some conditions of holding the phone in some specific way, and it's difficult to pinpoint the exact reason.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Nice as expected! Highly recommended  The beautiful beast is here!  Well, Moto has just nailed it. The first impressions are so good.  Beautiful: 1. The phone looks gorgeous in the hand. 2. Its slim and Bezel-less curved display makes it look ultra premium. 3. The back of the phone has got a velvet finish which makes it Scratch proof.  Beast: 1. The battery is insane. It lasted for 1.5 days easily for me with hotspot on and heavy usage. Moreover it charges completely in 30 min with the 125W charger given with the 12gb variant.  2. The performance is as smooth as my girlfriend's skin.  3. The camera details are crazy. Here's Einstein (my dog-baby and TailBlaze co-founder) in the photo. The setting was low-light but the details are crazy. 4. Wireless charging worked pretty smooth in my car and the speaker is insanely loud and clear. 5. Network reception is great too!  I mean this is the best phone I have ever put my hands on in this price range out of the 100 phones I have reviewed.  Kudos to Team Moto\n",

The mobile gets fully charged in 20 to 25 minutes and gives a backup of 30 to 32 hours. There is no heating issue in the mobile.  3 ) The look of the mobile is premium.

Also while charging the phone heats a lot even if you're not using it while charging. Overall it is a good phone but the price range is high compared to other phones compared to the performance. I hope the moto will fix these issues with updates\n",

Later when it becomes normal usage almost 1 day back up. Charging is super fast within 25-30 mins with a 125w ch arger. The charger is a big one, you need to buy an adapter, else it touches the switches.  User interface, need to adjust I was an apple user.  Curved display is a great experience. Flipkart experience is somewhat bad. Due to delay in delivery Many a times. Overall it's good purchase\n",

      "Product Name: Motorola Edge 50 Neo (PANTONE Latte, 256 GB)  (8 GB RAM)\n",
      "Product Price: ₹25,999\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: I ordered this phone due to a sudden issue with my old Poco X2. After 4.5 years of using other brands, it's great to be back with Motorola. The Moto Edge 50 Neo isn't for typical users who want a bigger battery, display, and performance. Instead, it's perfect for those who prefer a compact, one-handed phone with a great display and smooth functionality. It's not designed for gamers but suits those who appreciate a compact design with good performance. Thanks to Motorola for offering such a compact phone, saving me from spending a lot on a Google Pixel or Samsung S24.  **Pros:** 1. Fantastic design and build quality 2. Great display for this price range (almost as good as any flagship phone display) 3. Cameras have exceeded expectations 4. Clean software experience with the Hello UI 5. Good network reception and stable WiFi 6. Convenient size for one-handed use 7. Crystal clear sound quality 8. Good haptics  **Cons:** 1. Battery capacity and drain are common complaints. Initially, the battery drain is high for the first three days. However, the Edge 50 Neo uses AI to learn your usage patterns and optimizes battery drain, providing an average one-day battery life after optimization. The LTPO display also helps save battery.  2. Software update: well on paper Motorola promises 5 years of android and security patch updates. That's huge right! But going by the track records of Motorola software updates, updates were not frequent and sometimes not delivered at all. So I'm little bit sceptical about the software update promise. Let's see how Moto would keep it's promise.  Overall, the Motorola Edge 50 Neo is a unique smartphone targeting users who love compact phones with good performance and a clean software experience at a lower cost. If that sounds like you, it's definitely worth considering.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: This feels really very premium Quality is good at this price point along with 5 years update. The camera is quite good as it offers 3X optical zoom Touch and finish feels premium Charging speed is Really fast with a 68 watt charger Moto gestures are a big Plus It's like an iphone of the Android offering a 5 year update.  Must buy if You are looking for an all rounder phone\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: MUST KNOW BEFORE BUYING THIS PHONE--- 1. DON'T BUY if you are a GAMER, REEL ADDICT OR DOOM SCROLLER. 2. MUST BUY if you want DURABLE LONG LASTING SIMPLE COMPACT PHONE WHICH GETS THE JOB DONE.  Mind it- This phone doesn't have Greatest processor or battery, But It's built like a TANK and It's Camera Hardware is Very GOOD. Software processing needs to be FIXED. Battery lasts a Day if you use your phone like a tool it is and not like an addict. Hope it helps.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: I will write the review after a few days of usage.  Till then, the phone is not heating a lot, you will face a little trouble in finding the display tempered glass as the phone is too short and new.  Overall good but the transferring speed of data in UFS 2.2 seems a little slow but you will not feel anything in day to day usage.  Overall a Good Phone you can check, Next I will edit this after 7 days of usage  *Writing after 7 Days of usage*  Phone Display is too Good So the Speaker, you may feel little vibration but it is manageable, I have got 2 software within 7 days of purchase  Must add tempered glass to your list, the Glass is Gorila 3 you may notice a few scratches.  The only problem is the laggy camera in Photo mode. Although it is manageable, why. I hope moto will Fix this in the upcoming software update.  The battery is also not so bad I am a medium user it easily provides me 1Day Backup easily with about 6.2-6.3hr of SOT, and if I play game and do video records it gives around 5.5 to 5.7hr SOT\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: This phone is a perfect compact sized mid ranger for daily tasking n multi media etc (don't consider it specifically for gaming) overall a very balanced phone until now .  The in hand feel is very premium , the phone is light and fits very well in the hand because of its 6.3in compact display.  Moto's hello UI is very clean and smooth , with lots of features n customisations feels very premium.  Battery life , considering the 4310mah battery is very optimised and can easily last up to 8-9 hrs with moderate usage .  Phone's selfie camera is not so good as it generates very punchy skin colours (yellowish) and makes the tongue very (pinkish) but details are fine . On the other hand the rear camera is great , photos turn out very sharp and close to natural colour .  The media output is very good and loud , Dolby Atmos makes it balanced and sharp .  Remember moto phones don't have their own gallery app all the photos are stored in Google photos , not a big deal .  I can't say much about gaming as I haven't tried any heavy gaming as such ! But yaa a MD7300 processor is capable for decent gaming performance.  Hope moto keeps their promise of their timely OS and security updates . Overall a great phone for normal daily tasking, very smooth very fast !\n",

In this phone always on display is present which is not even in the edge 50 ultra( it will not turn off after few seconds like the midrange phones thanks to ltpo display). Cons 1. Camera app is a little bit jerky needs some optimization from moto. But it is not like complete useless. Skin tone are a bit reddish when light is low but it can be fixed. Gcam works fine 2. There is no lag while gaming. Cod supports 90fps But batter will drain fast like 20% in 1 hr so I will not recommend for gaming. But with casual gaming it is fine  Over all it is the best phone under 25k if this is your type phone\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: All rounder phone. I wish the battery was 4500, but that's fine no phone is perfect at all. Cameras are all usable and great. Not like other brands giving useless cameras. But sometimes I feel the photos are over saturated. Awesome display. And the smart connect feature is damn useful and great. The back cover is good quality. And the leather is smelling very nice and sweet. And I chose this phone over edge 50 and edge 50 fusion just because of its flat display. In short if you need a good phone with better software and clean android like features, not going to play many games, good camera and a good display and afterall compact phone this is the best choice in this segment.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: Here's a review based on experience:   *Motorola Edge 50 Neo Review: A Solid Performer  Rating: 4.5/5  I've spent 24 hours with the Motorola Edge 50 Neo, and here's my initial impression:   *Pros:*  1. *Decent Design*: The phone looks sleek and premium, with a comfortable grip. 2. *Impressive Camera*: The camera performance is impressive, capturing crisp and detailed photos. 3. *Smooth Performance*: The device handles everyday tasks seamlessly, with no noticeable lag. 4. *Feature-Packed*: Comes with WiFi 6, Bluetooth 5.2, and other modern connectivity options.   *Cons:*  1. *Battery Life*: Battery drain is relatively fast; 24 hours of moderate use (WiFi on, calls, and general usage) saw the battery drop to 40%. 2. *No Exceptional Features*: While it's a solid device, it lacks a standout feature to differentiate it from competitors.   *Verdict:*  The Motorola Edge 50 Neo is a reliable smartphone with good performance, camera quality, and design. However, battery life could be better. If you're looking for a device that checks all the boxes without breaking the bank, this might be a good option.   *Recommendation:*  For those who prioritize battery life, consider exploring other options. However, if you're willing to compromise on battery life for a well-rounded device, the Motorola Edge 50 Neo is worth considering.   *Rating Breakdown:*  - Design: 4/5 - Camera: 4.5/5 - Performance: 4.5/5 - Battery Life: 4.5/5 - Value for Money: 4.5/5\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: This review after using 7 days.  In many reviews, I saw many people saying the camera is not good. But after usage, I can say the camera is not so bad, it's very good, both front and back. Obviously you can't expect a DSLR like photography. It's a phone not a DSLR .  Battery backup with fast charging facility is very good. And RAM optimisation is amazing. It goes full day in moderate usage. If gaming then you should charge twice daily which is quite obvious. And this phone is not for hardcore gaming, if you want hardcore gaming, then purchase a gaming phone.  The display quality is just amazing and superb.  The size of the phone is quite handy and has a nice grip feeling to hold the leather back.  There is no heating issue found.  Conclusion : This is the must buy phone in 2024. Go for it without any hesitation. 😊❤️\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Best segment phone with great cameras and performance. I've been using this for a week now.  It has really good cameras, with good performance. The battery performs well and gives a full day on a single charge. It also takes around 40 mins to charge full. It feels very snappy and the display is really good. The size is also very comfortable. Thanks to it's compact size.  The only cons that I feel about this phone is the camera app. It stutters a lot. I felt while taking pictures. Maybe, if Motorola starts giving timely updates or an update might fix this issue. Rest, everything felt great. Also comes in a great price.  Overall, if you're looking for a great phone with good cameras, good IP rating, compact phone with the best display, military grade certified with 5 years of major android and security updates, this phone is a banger! A must buy. 🔥💯❤️\n",

      "Rating: 4, Review: The phone tends to heat up in daily usage, a typical characteristic of a mediatek processor phone.  A hard case is included in the box, a soft case would have been a better option.  Display looks crisp. Camera is decent. Performance while taking photos could have been improved from software perspective.  Migrated from an old phone to this one. All apps got installed, some got missed. Now installing those and logging in into all the apps.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: I have been looking for a perfect phone since a long and had done enough research and was confused between two but finally I went for this and trust me, this is one of the best decision I took. Flipkart delivery was fast.  - Coming to phone yes it has smaller battery and as per everyone I had same concern but moto has done a great optimization and till now I completed 8 to 10 cycle and every time I got more than 6 hours of Screen on time with moderate usage.  - Camera is mind-boggling, performance is also pretty good, although it's not gaming phone but I'm casual gamer and it can smoothly run couple of hours gaming without noticeable lag.  - Due to 1.5k resolution and 6.4 inches display, around 460 ppi with this display will look so clear even brightness is very high to use outdoor without any visibility issues, did not observe any Screen flickering in dark mode and low brightness.  - 5 years Android updates are something amazing, hopefully moto will stay on their words 😄  -Charging is pretty fast 10 minutes will give around 25% of juice, yes phone will get slightly warm during Charging but that's normal with any fast charging.  - Not to forget IP 68 and toughness of Mil grade, it's not just on paper, tried it and it's pretty sturdy build  Display 10/10 Camera 10/10 Battery 8/10 Performance 8.5/10 Build and color 11/10\n",

      "Rating: 4, Review: Here are Pros and Cons :  PROS: 1. Extremely light weight and compact phone. Its too good to be true! 2. Superb display and brightness. A bit saturated but you can tweak them at settings. 3. Fluid and clean UI with no unwanted blotwares. 4. Fast charging and wirless charging with charger and phone case in the box itself 5. Superb sound (though its a bit flat, its loud) 6. Battery backup is good. Keep black wallpaper, black UI and refresh rate at auto.  CONS : 1. Heatsup a bit 2. Camera UI is buggy and also colors are saturated. Also, the gallery takes 2 sec to process the image. 3. This is a con with all motorola phones : No call recorder app, no gallery, no myfiles, no music player,no app lock etc. It was really frustrating for me as my previous phone was samsung and it had all of these by default. These are basic apps and its a shame that motorola is not providing these. 4. Service centeres are not available everywhere. Please check whether your city has before you buy it. 5. Have to see whether motorola fulfills thier update promises as their update history has generally not been good.\n",
      "Rating: 3, Review: Battery could have been 5000 maH. Camera best amongst similar price phones, but phone majorly lacks in performance. Even the camera set-up although perfect, lags due to processor. In 23-24k price range, battery and processor are major flaws  Design and form factor is something you don't find elsewhere. So if your priority is good looking camera Phone which can be single handedly used, go for it. Performance seekers pls avoid it\n",

Software does have minor lags and stutter but nothing more than a few milliseconds. Go for it, if you're a regular user.\n",

The phone feels premium and compact in hands. Had shifted to this device from RM 2 Pro. I'm a normal user without gaming. With Dual SIMs and mobile data and the device lasts a day leaving 15- 20% end of the day. The Camera is good in this price bucket and the telephoto lens is an advantage for good captures. Moto should provide an App cloning and lock feature in the UI apart from the Secure Folder feature.\n",

I was impressed with the night photography. The best cameras.  3. Screen: Very impressive screen, eye comfort, and curved screen gives a very unique look to the phone.  4.

      "Rating: 5, Review: Do not believe the negative reviews. This is an amazing phone. I've switched from iPhone 11 and I'm in love with this already. I also got iPhone 14 plus for my wife but believe me this is much better than iPhone interms of display.  Display - 10/10 - The display is awesome. Crystal clear 1.5k resolution. The colours are punchy and lively. I'm using a 120Hz refresh rate and it's smooth as butter. Edge to edge display is really awesome. If I have to pick one thing about the phone then it's the display.  Camera - 9/10 - I haven't tested the camera a lot but the photos are coming really well.  Battery - 10/10 - No heat at all when charging the phone and it's changing insanely fast. I got a 128 watt charger along with this phone and it goes 0% to 100% in just 20 min. And I'm easily getting one day. I'm a medium-heavy user and I'm getting one day charging easily.  Performance - 9/10 - I got 12GB Ram version and no lags whatsoever. I played a few games and did not see any frame drops or lags. And it's handling high graphic settings like it's nothing.  Design -9/10 - it's very sleek and thin. I got the Lavender colour and I'm in love with it. When you hold it, it feels like a 60k-70k premium phone.  Overall Verdict - I have been an iPhone user for the past few years and I got bored with it. But I have been reluctant to switch to Android because the iPhone is amazing. I've used pixel 7a for a month before this but It had a lot of issues with fingerprint and face id recognition. But after using the Motorola edge 50 pro I might not switch back to the iPhone anytime soon. This is an amazing phone and you get everything compared to a high end premium phone. I'm in love with the display and you should definitely consider it.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: The beautiful beast is here!  Well, Moto has just nailed it. The first impressions are so good.  Beautiful: 1. The phone looks gorgeous in the hand. 2. Its slim and Bezel-less curved display makes it look ultra premium. 3. The back of the phone has got a velvet finish which makes it Scratch proof.  Beast: 1. The battery is insane. It lasted for 1.5 days easily for me with hotspot on and heavy usage. Moreover it charges completely in 30 min with the 125W charger given with the 12gb variant.  2. The performance is as smooth as my girlfriend's skin.  3. The camera details are crazy. Here's Einstein (my dog-baby and TailBlaze co-founder) in the photo. The setting was low-light but the details are crazy. 4. Wireless charging worked pretty smooth in my car and the speaker is insanely loud and clear. 5. Network reception is great too!  I mean this is the best phone I have ever put my hands on in this price range out of the 100 phones I have reviewed.  Kudos to Team Moto!\n",

The setting was low-light but the details are crazy. 4. Wireless charging worked pretty smooth in my car and the speaker is insanely loud and clear. 5. Network reception is great too!  I mean this is the best phone I have ever put my hands on in this price range out of the 100 phones I have reviewed.  Kudos to Team Moto!\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: I'm Giving Honest Review After Using it For more than 8Day .. let meat after 1 month.. I am Mentioning the Cons First.. 1. The Battery is not Efficient for a whole long day you have to charge it twice per day . If u are a normal user and use it on only a4g/lte network then u may use it for whole working day But if u are heavy user u have a charge it minimum 2 times or may be 3 times . It totally depends up to your uses and needs  Pros... But u will get 80/125 watts fqst charging adapter so don't worry it can charge only 40/20 min around .. actually they told 124 whattt charge it will take 19 min but it not true it take around 40 min  2.I noticed it's heating issues... bit don't think it's a Cons Caz I used I phone 12 for photography it is also get heated within 10 minutes of use so don't worry it's a normal  But if u are heavy Using it at outside in the sun or any temperature area then try to avoid it  If u use it for gaming or heavy use then try to sit any cool place like ac room or at least in front af fan then there is no heating issue.....  Some youtuber said if u aren't use tempered glass for the very first day it gets scratches but totally false cons.. 1.battery is not up to the mark 2.turbo charging is good but it will heat your phone too much 3. No official motorola store to buy accessories 4. Camera take few minutes to enhance photo 5. They provided plastic screen guard (film) Do not come with pre installed .  These phone gives u full of features and pro things .. 1. Display quality and brightness is awesome 2.camera is Next level it work with auto enhancement 3.Ram management is perfect . Still not found any choppy or lauggs 4.multitasking and gaming performance is good 5. Ip68 rating give u freedom to use worry free 6. It's comes with Dolby dual speakers sound Quality awesome 7. Most imp network quality it work 5g network Superficialy band is best 8. It's handy phone it will fits any size of hand 9. When it come in hand people noticed awesome feel 10.design is cool.\n",

      "Rating: 3, Review: Having issue with the double back tap option in the phone, it does not work most of the time. Apart from the had few issues with the performance, overall a decent phone. Anyone else having an issue with the double back tap (Quick launch) feature?\n",
      "Rating: 3, Review: The phone gets warm sometimes. Especially after the 1st boot up it got very hot. Also it gets warm when installing any app. Charging drops really fast even when you are playing less cpu/gpu intensive games. Even watching vids will reduce ur battery fast. The phone heating issue is kinda weird, it gets hot sometimes over the smallest of the tasks and sometimes it won't. If u use ur phone very less, the charge will probably stay for 1 or 2 days but that less of a usage is not possible nowadays. Given that Overheating and battery optimisation issues many reviewers are reporting, I hope they are fixable by software updates. It's really annoying that none of the YT reviewers mentioned these issues.\n",

Powerful Performance: The Snapdragon 7 Gen 3 chipset with up to 12GB RAM ensures smooth multitasking and gaming. 3. Impressive Camera System: The 50MP main camera, along with ultrawide and telephoto lenses, captures stunning photos. 4. Battery and Charging: The 4500mAh battery with 125W wired charging provides all-day usage and quick recharges. 5. Room for Improvement: Video recording stability and haptic feedback could have been better. I hope Motorola can fix the video recording part through a software update.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: I had moto edge 20 previously, it is a great update overall. Although moto has done a phenomenal job with the camera this time, they should also keep update cycles in mind this time. Still the camera needs some optimisation, it feels slower during processing of images. Don't step back seeing it's ufs 2.2, it is well optimised and supersedes its competitors. Well built phone for the price point. Although I had one complaint from moto that I didn't get any pre applied scratch guard on the phone, instead a scratch guard was provided in the box for self application, maybe this was a case with my unit only, so moto should address that in future shipments too.\n",

      "Rating: 4, Review: Haven't used the Motorola device for a long time. Using this for a couple of weeks now. Coming from Oneplus 7, I feel performance hasn't really dropped. Camera is definitely an upgrade and the only improvement area would be processing time for photos. Update can fix it. Display and design are top notch considering the price of the device. Haptics could have been better but remember what you are paying. Overall it's a flagship challenging device for sure. Good for daily use, charging speeds are insanely fast. I haven't observed heating issues at all. It just gets warm sometimes. Just hoping for on time software updates from Motorola at least after implementing the New UI. Please note that UFS storage and RAM type for this phone are well optimised and I haven't felt lag at all. I have purchased the moonlight Pearl and it looks standout from the rest of the Mobiles. One more suggestion for Motorola is to roll out some AI features that other brands are doing for better user experience. I will update the review after long term use.\n",

      "Rating: 4, Review: Here's my Honest Review:  Pros- Phone feels premium, design 5/5. 125W Charging is damn fast. Display is too good 5/5. Audio Quality is next level, as moto is using Dolby Atmos speakers. Camera: Portrait photos are really coming great.  Cons- Phone gets little warm while charging as it is 125W. But not a big deal. Even it's 4500 battery but still it will last you whole day. Photo processing takes 2-3 seconds.  Conclusion:- if you need a flagship experience phone, a complete balanced phone great camera, display, audio, design then just go for it.  But if you are a kid below 20 who plays games alot and don't care about camera, display etc then you buy performance centric phone. But if you need balanced phone then moto edge 50 pro is best.  In summary: moto took best parts of different companies like camera of Sony, LG OLED display, Speakers of Dolby Atmos, combined all and build this phone with moto branding.  My overall Rating is 4.5/5\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: I usually don't write reviews but this phone deserves every praise there is to offer. Phone usually charges within 20-30 mins. And gives a whole day worth of screen time. The curved display is fantastic to touch and watch. Brightness is too good (I use it at 60%) and it's still too bright. The processor is pretty good for gaming and daily usage. UI is pretty good and easy to use. Camera is awesome and preforms better than expectations. Especially the AI zoom... People were surprised when they saw the quality of images and videos this camera delivers. Lastly, the water resistance.... Today I went to WoW Waterpark and took the phone with me in all the rides... Suffice to say not a single issue with the phone and the videos are top notch. Anyone looking to buy a good mid range phone should definitely buy this without giving a second thought. Moto has really outdone itself with this model.\n",

The performance is on par for the segment, and there is absolutely no lag for day to day standard usage. The phone does get warm during some operations, but it is well within the limit.  The only negative is that the curved edge sometimes results in touch related issues. It happens only in some conditions of holding the phone in some specific way, and it's difficult to pinpoint the exact reason.\n",

The charger is a big one, you need to buy an adapter, else it touches the switches.  User interface, need to adjust I was an apple user.  Curved display is a great experience.

      "Rating: 5, Review: I ordered this phone due to a sudden issue with my old Poco X2. After 4.5 years of using other brands, it's great to be back with Motorola. The Moto Edge 50 Neo isn't for typical users who want a bigger battery, display, and performance. Instead, it's perfect for those who prefer a compact, one-handed phone with a great display and smooth functionality. It's not designed for gamers but suits those who appreciate a compact design with good performance. Thanks to Motorola for offering such a compact phone, saving me from spending a lot on a Google Pixel or Samsung S24.  **Pros:** 1. Fantastic design and build quality 2. Great display for this price range (almost as good as any flagship phone display) 3. Cameras have exceeded expectations 4. Clean software experience with the Hello UI 5. Good network reception and stable WiFi 6. Convenient size for one-handed use 7. Crystal clear sound quality 8. Good haptics  **Cons:** 1. Battery capacity and drain are common complaints. Initially, the battery drain is high for the first three days. However, the Edge 50 Neo uses AI to learn your usage patterns and optimizes battery drain, providing an average one-day battery life after optimization. The LTPO display also helps save battery.  2. Software update: well on paper Motorola promises 5 years of android and security patch updates. That's huge right! But going by the track records of Motorola software updates, updates were not frequent and sometimes not delivered at all. So I'm little bit sceptical about the software update promise. Let's see how Moto would keep it's promise.  Overall, the Motorola Edge 50 Neo is a unique smartphone targeting users who love compact phones with good performance and a clean software experience at a lower cost. If that sounds like you, it's definitely worth considering.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: This feels really very premium Quality is good at this price point along with 5 years update. The camera is quite good as it offers 3X optical zoom Touch and finish feels premium Charging speed is Really fast with a 68 watt charger Moto gestures are a big Plus It's like an iphone of the Android offering a 5 year update.  Must buy if You are looking for an all rounder phone\n",

Mind it- This phone doesn't have Greatest processor or battery, But It's built like a TANK and It's Camera Hardware is Very GOOD. Software processing needs to be FIXED. Battery lasts a Day if you use your phone like a tool it is and not like an addict. Hope it helps.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: I will write the review after a few days of usage.  Till then, the phone is not heating a lot, you will face a little trouble in finding the display tempered glass as the phone is too short and new.  Overall good but the transferring speed of data in UFS 2.2 seems a little slow but you will not feel anything in day to day usage.  Overall a Good Phone you can check, Next I will edit this after 7 days of usage  *Writing after 7 Days of usage*  Phone Display is too Good So the Speaker, you may feel little vibration but it is manageable, I have got 2 software within 7 days of purchase  Must add tempered glass to your list, the Glass is Gorila 3 you may notice a few scratches.  The only problem is the laggy camera in Photo mode. Although it is manageable, why. I hope moto will Fix this in the upcoming software update.  The battery is also not so bad I am a medium user it easily provides me 1Day Backup easily with about 6.2-6.3hr of SOT, and if I play game and do video records it gives around 5.5 to 5.7hr SOT\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: I recently purchased the Motorola Edge 50 Neo ❤️, and it has exceeded my expectations! The sleek design and vibrant display make for a stunning visual experience, while the performance is incredibly smooth, handling all apps and games effortlessly. The camera quality is fantastic, capturing sharp and vivid photos even in low light. Battery life is impressive, lasting through a full day of heavy use. I also love the clean Android experience without any bloatware. Overall, this phone offers amazing value for its price, and I highly recommend it!\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: Ditched my decision of buying edge 50 fusion at the last minute and went with this. It's a wonderful phone. Performance is good for some one who does routine tasks and not into extreme gaming( though I had no issue with playing PUBg)  Pros: ----- 1. Design and look and color 2. Great Display 3. Small and light form factor 4. Camera 5. OS and Moto AI especially AI generated wallpaper 6. Performance 7. No heating  Cons: ------ 1. Small battery 2. No audio jack  Also was confused between Poinciana and Latte color and trust me Latte is too good in real. Glad I didn't make the wrong choice\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: This phone is a perfect compact sized mid ranger for daily tasking n multi media etc (don't consider it specifically for gaming) overall a very balanced phone until now .  The in hand feel is very premium , the phone is light and fits very well in the hand because of its 6.3in compact display.  Moto's hello UI is very clean and smooth , with lots of features n customisations feels very premium.  Battery life , considering the 4310mah battery is very optimised and can easily last up to 8-9 hrs with moderate usage .  Phone's selfie camera is not so good as it generates very punchy skin colours (yellowish) and makes the tongue very (pinkish) but details are fine . On the other hand the rear camera is great , photos turn out very sharp and close to natural colour .  The media output is very good and loud , Dolby Atmos makes it balanced and sharp .  Remember moto phones don't have their own gallery app all the photos are stored in Google photos , not a big deal .  I can't say much about gaming as I haven't tried any heavy gaming as such ! But yaa a MD7300 processor is capable for decent gaming performance.  Hope moto keeps their promise of their timely OS and security updates . Overall a great phone for normal daily tasking, very smooth very fast !\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: If you are looking for a compact phone with good cameras and decent performance and stock android without any ads this phone is for you.  Pros 1.display is really impressive with 1.5k 120 hz ltpo and bezels are so thin 2. Design is very eye pleadings with vegan leather and it is so comfortable to hold 3.battery backup is actually good( I was expecting worse) i got sot 6-7hrs with moderate usage (refresh rate at auto). 4.camera is really good in this price range with 3x telephoto I am addicted using it. Videos comes out really good with no jitters and shaking. 5.ui experience is really good too with no ads and bloatwares and also so many moto features. In this phone always on display is present which is not even in the edge 50 ultra( it will not turn off after few seconds like the midrange phones thanks to ltpo display). Cons 1. Camera app is a little bit jerky needs some optimization from moto. But it is not like complete useless. Skin tone are a bit reddish when light is low but it can be fixed. Gcam works fine 2. There is no lag while gaming. Cod supports 90fps But batter will drain fast like 20% in 1 hr so I will not recommend for gaming. But with casual gaming it is fine  Over all it is the best phone under 25k if this is your type phone\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: All rounder phone. I wish the battery was 4500, but that's fine no phone is perfect at all. Cameras are all usable and great. Not like other brands giving useless cameras. But sometimes I feel the photos are over saturated. Awesome display. And the smart connect feature is damn useful and great. The back cover is good quality. And the leather is smelling very nice and sweet. And I chose this phone over edge 50 and edge 50 fusion just because of its flat display. In short if you need a good phone with better software and clean android like features, not going to play many games, good camera and a good display and afterall compact phone this is the best choice in this segment.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: Here's a review based on experience:   *Motorola Edge 50 Neo Review: A Solid Performer  Rating: 4.5/5  I've spent 24 hours with the Motorola Edge 50 Neo, and here's my initial impression:   *Pros:*  1. *Decent Design*: The phone looks sleek and premium, with a comfortable grip. 2. *Impressive Camera*: The camera performance is impressive, capturing crisp and detailed photos. 3. *Smooth Performance*: The device handles everyday tasks seamlessly, with no noticeable lag. 4. *Feature-Packed*: Comes with WiFi 6, Bluetooth 5.2, and other modern connectivity options.   *Cons:*  1. *Battery Life*: Battery drain is relatively fast; 24 hours of moderate use (WiFi on, calls, and general usage) saw the battery drop to 40%. 2. *No Exceptional Features*: While it's a solid device, it lacks a standout feature to differentiate it from competitors.   *Verdict:*  The Motorola Edge 50 Neo is a reliable smartphone with good performance, camera quality, and design. However, battery life could be better. If you're looking for a device that checks all the boxes without breaking the bank, this might be a good option.   *Recommendation:*  For those who prioritize battery life, consider exploring other options. However, if you're willing to compromise on battery life for a well-rounded device, the Motorola Edge 50 Neo is worth considering.   *Rating Breakdown:*  - Design: 4/5 - Camera: 4.5/5 - Performance: 4.5/5 - Battery Life: 4.5/5 - Value for Money: 4.5/5\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: This review after using 7 days.  In many reviews, I saw many people saying the camera is not good. But after usage, I can say the camera is not so bad, it's very good, both front and back. Obviously you can't expect a DSLR like photography. It's a phone not a DSLR .  Battery backup with fast charging facility is very good. And RAM optimisation is amazing. It goes full day in moderate usage. If gaming then you should charge twice daily which is quite obvious. And this phone is not for hardcore gaming, if you want hardcore gaming, then purchase a gaming phone.  The display quality is just amazing and superb.  The size of the phone is quite handy and has a nice grip feeling to hold the leather back.  There is no heating issue found.  Conclusion : This is the must buy phone in 2024. Go for it without any hesitation. 😊❤️\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Best segment phone with great cameras and performance. I've been using this for a week now.  It has really good cameras, with good performance. The battery performs well and gives a full day on a single charge. It also takes around 40 mins to charge full. It feels very snappy and the display is really good. The size is also very comfortable. Thanks to it's compact size.  The only cons that I feel about this phone is the camera app. It stutters a lot. I felt while taking pictures. Maybe, if Motorola starts giving timely updates or an update might fix this issue. Rest, everything felt great. Also comes in a great price.  Overall, if you're looking for a great phone with good cameras, good IP rating, compact phone with the best display, military grade certified with 5 years of major android and security updates, this phone is a banger! A must buy. 🔥💯❤️\n",

A hard case is included in the box, a soft case would have been a better option.  Display looks crisp. Camera is decent.

      "Rating: 5, Review: I have been looking for a perfect phone since a long and had done enough research and was confused between two but finally I went for this and trust me, this is one of the best decision I took. Flipkart delivery was fast.  - Coming to phone yes it has smaller battery and as per everyone I had same concern but moto has done a great optimization and till now I completed 8 to 10 cycle and every time I got more than 6 hours of Screen on time with moderate usage.  - Camera is mind-boggling, performance is also pretty good, although it's not gaming phone but I'm casual gamer and it can smoothly run couple of hours gaming without noticeable lag.  - Due to 1.5k resolution and 6.4 inches display, around 460 ppi with this display will look so clear even brightness is very high to use outdoor without any visibility issues, did not observe any Screen flickering in dark mode and low brightness.  - 5 years Android updates are something amazing, hopefully moto will stay on their words 😄  -Charging is pretty fast 10 minutes will give around 25% of juice, yes phone will get slightly warm during Charging but that's normal with any fast charging.  - Not to forget IP 68 and toughness of Mil grade, it's not just on paper, tried it and it's pretty sturdy build  Display 10/10 Camera 10/10 Battery 8/10 Performance 8.5/10 Build and color 11/10\n",

      "Rating: 4, Review: Here are Pros and Cons :  PROS: 1. Extremely light weight and compact phone. Its too good to be true! 2. Superb display and brightness. A bit saturated but you can tweak them at settings. 3. Fluid and clean UI with no unwanted blotwares. 4. Fast charging and wirless charging with charger and phone case in the box itself 5. Superb sound (though its a bit flat, its loud) 6. Battery backup is good. Keep black wallpaper, black UI and refresh rate at auto.  CONS : 1. Heatsup a bit 2. Camera UI is buggy and also colors are saturated. Also, the gallery takes 2 sec to process the image. 3. This is a con with all motorola phones : No call recorder app, no gallery, no myfiles, no music player,no app lock etc. It was really frustrating for me as my previous phone was samsung and it had all of these by default. These are basic apps and its a shame that motorola is not providing these. 4. Service centeres are not available everywhere. Please check whether your city has before you buy it. 5. Have to see whether motorola fulfills thier update promises as their update history has generally not been good.\n",
      "Rating: 3, Review: Battery could have been 5000 maH. Camera best amongst similar price phones, but phone majorly lacks in performance. Even the camera set-up although perfect, lags due to processor. In 23-24k price range, battery and processor are major flaws  Design and form factor is something you don't find elsewhere. So if your priority is good looking camera Phone which can be single handedly used, go for it. Performance seekers pls avoid it\n",

With Dual SIMs and mobile data and the device lasts a day leaving 15- 20% end of the day. The Camera is good in this price bucket and the telephoto lens is an advantage for good captures.

      "Product Name: Motorola Edge 50 Neo (PANTONE Poinciana, 256 GB)  (8 GB RAM)\n",
      "Product Price: ₹25,999\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: I ordered this phone due to a sudden issue with my old Poco X2. After 4.5 years of using other brands, it's great to be back with Motorola. The Moto Edge 50 Neo isn't for typical users who want a bigger battery, display, and performance. Instead, it's perfect for those who prefer a compact, one-handed phone with a great display and smooth functionality. It's not designed for gamers but suits those who appreciate a compact design with good performance. Thanks to Motorola for offering such a compact phone, saving me from spending a lot on a Google Pixel or Samsung S24.  **Pros:** 1. Fantastic design and build quality 2. Great display for this price range (almost as good as any flagship phone display) 3. Cameras have exceeded expectations 4. Clean software experience with the Hello UI 5. Good network reception and stable WiFi 6. Convenient size for one-handed use 7. Crystal clear sound quality 8. Good haptics  **Cons:** 1. Battery capacity and drain are common complaints. Initially, the battery drain is high for the first three days. However, the Edge 50 Neo uses AI to learn your usage patterns and optimizes battery drain, providing an average one-day battery life after optimization. The LTPO display also helps save battery.  2. Software update: well on paper Motorola promises 5 years of android and security patch updates. That's huge right! But going by the track records of Motorola software updates, updates were not frequent and sometimes not delivered at all. So I'm little bit sceptical about the software update promise. Let's see how Moto would keep it's promise.  Overall, the Motorola Edge 50 Neo is a unique smartphone targeting users who love compact phones with good performance and a clean software experience at a lower cost.

      "Rating: 5, Review: MUST KNOW BEFORE BUYING THIS PHONE--- 1. DON'T BUY if you are a GAMER, REEL ADDICT OR DOOM SCROLLER. 2. MUST BUY if you want DURABLE LONG LASTING SIMPLE COMPACT PHONE WHICH GETS THE JOB DONE.  Mind it- This phone doesn't have Greatest processor or battery, But It's built like a TANK and It's Camera Hardware is Very GOOD. Software processing needs to be FIXED. Battery lasts a Day if you use your phone like a tool it is and not like an addict. Hope it helps.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: I will write the review after a few days of usage.  Till then, the phone is not heating a lot, you will face a little trouble in finding the display tempered glass as the phone is too short and new.  Overall good but the transferring speed of data in UFS 2.2 seems a little slow but you will not feel anything in day to day usage.  Overall a Good Phone you can check, Next I will edit this after 7 days of usage  *Writing after 7 Days of usage*  Phone Display is too Good So the Speaker, you may feel little vibration but it is manageable, I have got 2 software within 7 days of purchase  Must add tempered glass to your list, the Glass is Gorila 3 you may notice a few scratches.  The only problem is the laggy camera in Photo mode. Although it is manageable, why. I hope moto will Fix this in the upcoming software update.  The battery is also not so bad I am a medium user it easily provides me 1Day Backup easily with about 6.2-6.3hr of SOT, and if I play game and do video records it gives around 5.5 to 5.7hr SOT\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: I recently purchased the Motorola Edge 50 Neo ❤️, and it has exceeded my expectations! The sleek design and vibrant display make for a stunning visual experience, while the performance is incredibly smooth, handling all apps and games effortlessly. The camera quality is fantastic, capturing sharp and vivid photos even in low light. Battery life is impressive, lasting through a full day of heavy use. I also love the clean Android experience without any bloatware. Overall, this phone offers amazing value for its price, and I highly recommend it!\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: Ditched my decision of buying edge 50 fusion at the last minute and went with this. It's a wonderful phone. Performance is good for some one who does routine tasks and not into extreme gaming( though I had no issue with playing PUBg)  Pros: ----- 1. Design and look and color 2. Great Display 3. Small and light form factor 4. Camera 5. OS and Moto AI especially AI generated wallpaper 6. Performance 7. No heating  Cons: ------ 1. Small battery 2. No audio jack  Also was confused between Poinciana and Latte color and trust me Latte is too good in real. Glad I didn't make the wrong choice\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: This phone is a perfect compact sized mid ranger for daily tasking n multi media etc (don't consider it specifically for gaming) overall a very balanced phone until now .  The in hand feel is very premium , the phone is light and fits very well in the hand because of its 6.3in compact display.  Moto's hello UI is very clean and smooth , with lots of features n customisations feels very premium.  Battery life , considering the 4310mah battery is very optimised and can easily last up to 8-9 hrs with moderate usage .  Phone's selfie camera is not so good as it generates very punchy skin colours (yellowish) and makes the tongue very (pinkish) but details are fine . On the other hand the rear camera is great , photos turn out very sharp and close to natural colour .  The media output is very good and loud , Dolby Atmos makes it balanced and sharp .  Remember moto phones don't have their own gallery app all the photos are stored in Google photos , not a big deal .  I can't say much about gaming as I haven't tried any heavy gaming as such ! But yaa a MD7300 processor is capable for decent gaming performance.  Hope moto keeps their promise of their timely OS and security updates . Overall a great phone for normal daily tasking, very smooth very fast !\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: If you are looking for a compact phone with good cameras and decent performance and stock android without any ads this phone is for you.  Pros 1.display is really impressive with 1.5k 120 hz ltpo and bezels are so thin 2. Design is very eye pleadings with vegan leather and it is so comfortable to hold 3.battery backup is actually good( I was expecting worse) i got sot 6-7hrs with moderate usage (refresh rate at auto). 4.camera is really good in this price range with 3x telephoto I am addicted using it. Videos comes out really good with no jitters and shaking. 5.ui experience is really good too with no ads and bloatwares and also so many moto features. In this phone always on display is present which is not even in the edge 50 ultra( it will not turn off after few seconds like the midrange phones thanks to ltpo display). Cons 1. Camera app is a little bit jerky needs some optimization from moto. But it is not like complete useless. Skin tone are a bit reddish when light is low but it can be fixed. Gcam works fine 2. There is no lag while gaming. Cod supports 90fps But batter will drain fast like 20% in 1 hr so I will not recommend for gaming. But with casual gaming it is fine  Over all it is the best phone under 25k if this is your type phone\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: All rounder phone. I wish the battery was 4500, but that's fine no phone is perfect at all. Cameras are all usable and great. Not like other brands giving useless cameras. But sometimes I feel the photos are over saturated. Awesome display. And the smart connect feature is damn useful and great. The back cover is good quality. And the leather is smelling very nice and sweet. And I chose this phone over edge 50 and edge 50 fusion just because of its flat display. In short if you need a good phone with better software and clean android like features, not going to play many games, good camera and a good display and afterall compact phone this is the best choice in this segment.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: Here's a review based on experience:   *Motorola Edge 50 Neo Review: A Solid Performer  Rating: 4.5/5  I've spent 24 hours with the Motorola Edge 50 Neo, and here's my initial impression:   *Pros:*  1. *Decent Design*: The phone looks sleek and premium, with a comfortable grip. 2. *Impressive Camera*: The camera performance is impressive, capturing crisp and detailed photos. 3. *Smooth Performance*: The device handles everyday tasks seamlessly, with no noticeable lag. 4. *Feature-Packed*: Comes with WiFi 6, Bluetooth 5.2, and other modern connectivity options.   *Cons:*  1. *Battery Life*: Battery drain is relatively fast; 24 hours of moderate use (WiFi on, calls, and general usage) saw the battery drop to 40%. 2. *No Exceptional Features*: While it's a solid device, it lacks a standout feature to differentiate it from competitors.   *Verdict:*  The Motorola Edge 50 Neo is a reliable smartphone with good performance, camera quality, and design. However, battery life could be better. If you're looking for a device that checks all the boxes without breaking the bank, this might be a good option.   *Recommendation:*  For those who prioritize battery life, consider exploring other options. However, if you're willing to compromise on battery life for a well-rounded device, the Motorola Edge 50 Neo is worth considering.   *Rating Breakdown:*  - Design: 4/5 - Camera: 4.5/5 - Performance: 4.5/5 - Battery Life: 4.5/5 - Value for Money: 4.5/5\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: This review after using 7 days.  In many reviews, I saw many people saying the camera is not good. But after usage, I can say the camera is not so bad, it's very good, both front and back. Obviously you can't expect a DSLR like photography. It's a phone not a DSLR .  Battery backup with fast charging facility is very good. And RAM optimisation is amazing. It goes full day in moderate usage. If gaming then you should charge twice daily which is quite obvious. And this phone is not for hardcore gaming, if you want hardcore gaming, then purchase a gaming phone.  The display quality is just amazing and superb.  The size of the phone is quite handy and has a nice grip feeling to hold the leather back.  There is no heating issue found.  Conclusion : This is the must buy phone in 2024. Go for it without any hesitation. 😊❤️\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Best segment phone with great cameras and performance. I've been using this for a week now.  It has really good cameras, with good performance. The battery performs well and gives a full day on a single charge. It also takes around 40 mins to charge full. It feels very snappy and the display is really good. The size is also very comfortable. Thanks to it's compact size.  The only cons that I feel about this phone is the camera app. It stutters a lot. I felt while taking pictures. Maybe, if Motorola starts giving timely updates or an update might fix this issue. Rest, everything felt great. Also comes in a great price.  Overall, if you're looking for a great phone with good cameras, good IP rating, compact phone with the best display, military grade certified with 5 years of major android and security updates, this phone is a banger! A must buy. 🔥💯❤️\n",

A hard case is included in the box, a soft case would have been a better option.  Display looks crisp. Camera is decent. Performance while taking photos could have been improved from software perspective.  Migrated from an old phone to this one. All apps got installed, some got missed. Now installing those and logging in into all the apps.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: I have been looking for a perfect phone since a long and had done enough research and was confused between two but finally I went for this and trust me, this is one of the best decision I took. Flipkart delivery was fast.  - Coming to phone yes it has smaller battery and as per everyone I had same concern but moto has done a great optimization and till now I completed 8 to 10 cycle and every time I got more than 6 hours of Screen on time with moderate usage.  - Camera is mind-boggling, performance is also pretty good, although it's not gaming phone but I'm casual gamer and it can smoothly run couple of hours gaming without noticeable lag.  - Due to 1.5k resolution and 6.4 inches display, around 460 ppi with this display will look so clear even brightness is very high to use outdoor without any visibility issues, did not observe any Screen flickering in dark mode and low brightness.  - 5 years Android updates are something amazing, hopefully moto will stay on their words 😄  -Charging is pretty fast 10 minutes will give around 25% of juice, yes phone will get slightly warm during Charging but that's normal with any fast charging.  - Not to forget IP 68 and toughness of Mil grade, it's not just on paper, tried it and it's pretty sturdy build  Display 10/10 Camera 10/10 Battery 8/10 Performance 8.5/10 Build and color 11/10\n",

      "Rating: 4, Review: Here are Pros and Cons :  PROS: 1. Extremely light weight and compact phone. Its too good to be true! 2. Superb display and brightness. A bit saturated but you can tweak them at settings. 3. Fluid and clean UI with no unwanted blotwares. 4. Fast charging and wirless charging with charger and phone case in the box itself 5. Superb sound (though its a bit flat, its loud) 6. Battery backup is good. Keep black wallpaper, black UI and refresh rate at auto.  CONS : 1. Heatsup a bit 2. Camera UI is buggy and also colors are saturated. Also, the gallery takes 2 sec to process the image. 3. This is a con with all motorola phones : No call recorder app, no gallery, no myfiles, no music player,no app lock etc. It was really frustrating for me as my previous phone was samsung and it had all of these by default. These are basic apps and its a shame that motorola is not providing these. 4. Service centeres are not available everywhere. Please check whether your city has before you buy it. 5. Have to see whether motorola fulfills thier update promises as their update history has generally not been good.\n",
      "Rating: 3, Review: Battery could have been 5000 maH. Camera best amongst similar price phones, but phone majorly lacks in performance. Even the camera set-up although perfect, lags due to processor. In 23-24k price range, battery and processor are major flaws  Design and form factor is something you don't find elsewhere. So if your priority is good looking camera Phone which can be single handedly used, go for it. Performance seekers pls avoid it\n",

With Dual SIMs and mobile data and the device lasts a day leaving 15- 20% end of the day. The Camera is good in this price bucket and the telephoto lens is an advantage for good captures.

      "Rating: 5, Review: I have been using this mobile for the last 6 days and overall I am very Happy with this mobile.  1. Design: The design is very eye-catching and, feels very good and confident to hold in hand.  2. Camera: Camera set up is really awesome and best in this segment. I was impressed with the night photography. The best cameras.  3. Screen: Very impressive screen, eye comfort, and curved screen gives a very unique look to the phone.  4. Battery: Battery back is good for one full day by keeping the internet all the time on. I especially want to talk about a 125W charger which really charges mobile in less time.  I am really happy with this mobile and recommend buying it.\n",

      "Rating: 4, Review: Just received my moto edge 50 pro yesterday. Look wise mobile is very good. All accessories were in the box, although the back cover is kind of useless. The 125W charger is charging mobile fast as advertised by moto. As of now the performance looks great. Camera is great specially front camera. Colors are quite realistic. I've given 4 star as of now, will update my review after few weeks of use.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: Do not believe the negative reviews. This is an amazing phone. I've switched from iPhone 11 and I'm in love with this already. I also got iPhone 14 plus for my wife but believe me this is much better than iPhone interms of display.  Display - 10/10 - The display is awesome. Crystal clear 1.5k resolution. The colours are punchy and lively. I'm using a 120Hz refresh rate and it's smooth as butter. Edge to edge display is really awesome. If I have to pick one thing about the phone then it's the display.  Camera - 9/10 - I haven't tested the camera a lot but the photos are coming really well.  Battery - 10/10 - No heat at all when charging the phone and it's changing insanely fast. I got a 128 watt charger along with this phone and it goes 0% to 100% in just 20 min. And I'm easily getting one day. I'm a medium-heavy user and I'm getting one day charging easily.  Performance - 9/10 - I got 12GB Ram version and no lags whatsoever. I played a few games and did not see any frame drops or lags. And it's handling high graphic settings like it's nothing.  Design -9/10 - it's very sleek and thin. I got the Lavender colour and I'm in love with it. When you hold it, it feels like a 60k-70k premium phone.  Overall Verdict - I have been an iPhone user for the past few years and I got bored with it. But I have been reluctant to switch to Android because the iPhone is amazing. I've used pixel 7a for a month before this but It had a lot of issues with fingerprint and face id recognition. But after using the Motorola edge 50 pro I might not switch back to the iPhone anytime soon. This is an amazing phone and you get everything compared to a high end premium phone. I'm in love with the display and you should definitely consider it.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: The beautiful beast is here!  Well, Moto has just nailed it. The first impressions are so good.  Beautiful: 1. The phone looks gorgeous in the hand. 2. Its slim and Bezel-less curved display makes it look ultra premium. 3. The back of the phone has got a velvet finish which makes it Scratch proof.  Beast: 1. The battery is insane. It lasted for 1.5 days easily for me with hotspot on and heavy usage. Moreover it charges completely in 30 min with the 125W charger given with the 12gb variant.  2. The performance is as smooth as my girlfriend's skin.  3. The camera details are crazy. Here's Einstein (my dog-baby and TailBlaze co-founder) in the photo. The setting was low-light but the details are crazy. 4. Wireless charging worked pretty smooth in my car and the speaker is insanely loud and clear. 5. Network reception is great too!  I mean this is the best phone I have ever put my hands on in this price range out of the 100 phones I have reviewed.  Kudos to Team Moto!\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: I'm Giving Honest Review After Using it For more than 8Day .. let meat after 1 month.. I am Mentioning the Cons First.. 1. The Battery is not Efficient for a whole long day you have to charge it twice per day . If u are a normal user and use it on only a4g/lte network then u may use it for whole working day But if u are heavy user u have a charge it minimum 2 times or may be 3 times . It totally depends up to your uses and needs  Pros... But u will get 80/125 watts fqst charging adapter so don't worry it can charge only 40/20 min around .. actually they told 124 whattt charge it will take 19 min but it not true it take around 40 min  2.I noticed it's heating issues... bit don't think it's a Cons Caz I used I phone 12 for photography it is also get heated within 10 minutes of use so don't worry it's a normal  But if u are heavy Using it at outside in the sun or any temperature area then try to avoid it  If u use it for gaming or heavy use then try to sit any cool place like ac room or at least in front af fan then there is no heating issue.....  Some youtuber said if u aren't use tempered glass for the very first day it gets scratches but totally false cons.. 1.battery is not up to the mark 2.turbo charging is good but it will heat your phone too much 3. No official motorola store to buy accessories 4. Camera take few minutes to enhance photo 5. They provided plastic screen guard (film) Do not come with pre installed .  These phone gives u full of features and pro things .. 1. Display quality and brightness is awesome 2.camera is Next level it work with auto enhancement 3.Ram management is perfect . Still not found any choppy or lauggs 4.multitasking and gaming performance is good 5. Ip68 rating give u freedom to use worry free 6. It's comes with Dolby dual speakers sound Quality awesome 7. Most imp network quality it work 5g network Superficialy band is best 8. It's handy phone it will fits any size of hand 9. When it come in hand people noticed awesome feel 10.design is cool.\n",

      "Rating: 3, Review: Having issue with the double back tap option in the phone, it does not work most of the time. Apart from the had few issues with the performance, overall a decent phone. Anyone else having an issue with the double back tap (Quick launch) feature?\n",
      "Rating: 3, Review: The phone gets warm sometimes. Especially after the 1st boot up it got very hot. Also it gets warm when installing any app. Charging drops really fast even when you are playing less cpu/gpu intensive games. Even watching vids will reduce ur battery fast. The phone heating issue is kinda weird, it gets hot sometimes over the smallest of the tasks and sometimes it won't. If u use ur phone very less, the charge will probably stay for 1 or 2 days but that less of a usage is not possible nowadays. Given that Overheating and battery optimisation issues many reviewers are reporting, I hope they are fixable by software updates. It's really annoying that none of the YT reviewers mentioned these issues.\n",

Powerful Performance: The Snapdragon 7 Gen 3 chipset with up to 12GB RAM ensures smooth multitasking and gaming. 3. Impressive Camera System: The 50MP main camera, along with ultrawide and telephoto lenses, captures stunning photos. 4. Battery and Charging: The 4500mAh battery with 125W wired charging provides all-day usage and quick recharges. 5. Room for Improvement: Video recording stability and haptic feedback could have been better. I hope Motorola can fix the video recording part through a software update.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: I had moto edge 20 previously, it is a great update overall. Although moto has done a phenomenal job with the camera this time, they should also keep update cycles in mind this time. Still the camera needs some optimisation, it feels slower during processing of images. Don't step back seeing it's ufs 2.2, it is well optimised and supersedes its competitors. Well built phone for the price point. Although I had one complaint from moto that I didn't get any pre applied scratch guard on the phone, instead a scratch guard was provided in the box for self application, maybe this was a case with my unit only, so moto should address that in future shipments too.\n",

      "Rating: 4, Review: Haven't used the Motorola device for a long time. Using this for a couple of weeks now. Coming from Oneplus 7, I feel performance hasn't really dropped. Camera is definitely an upgrade and the only improvement area would be processing time for photos. Update can fix it. Display and design are top notch considering the price of the device. Haptics could have been better but remember what you are paying. Overall it's a flagship challenging device for sure. Good for daily use, charging speeds are insanely fast. I haven't observed heating issues at all. It just gets warm sometimes. Just hoping for on time software updates from Motorola at least after implementing the New UI. Please note that UFS storage and RAM type for this phone are well optimised and I haven't felt lag at all. I have purchased the moonlight Pearl and it looks standout from the rest of the Mobiles. One more suggestion for Motorola is to roll out some AI features that other brands are doing for better user experience. I will update the review after long term use.\n",

      "Rating: 3, Review: Mobile is Good. But , battery 🔋 optimisation is not good. Because I am not a heavy user, I still charge my mobile minimum 3 times per day. Maybe it' will be solved in the next update.\n",
      "Rating: 4, Review: Here's my Honest Review:  Pros- Phone feels premium, design 5/5. 125W Charging is damn fast. Display is too good 5/5. Audio Quality is next level, as moto is using Dolby Atmos speakers. Camera: Portrait photos are really coming great.  Cons- Phone gets little warm while charging as it is 125W. But not a big deal. Even it's 4500 battery but still it will last you whole day. Photo processing takes 2-3 seconds.  Conclusion:- if you need a flagship experience phone, a complete balanced phone great camera, display, audio, design then just go for it.  But if you are a kid below 20 who plays games alot and don't care about camera, display etc then you buy performance centric phone. But if you need balanced phone then moto edge 50 pro is best.  In summary: moto took best parts of different companies like camera of Sony, LG OLED display, Speakers of Dolby Atmos, combined all and build this phone with moto branding.  My overall Rating is 4.5/5\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: I usually don't write reviews but this phone deserves every praise there is to offer. Phone usually charges within 20-30 mins. And gives a whole day worth of screen time. The curved display is fantastic to touch and watch. Brightness is too good (I use it at 60%) and it's still too bright. The processor is pretty good for gaming and daily usage. UI is pretty good and easy to use. Camera is awesome and preforms better than expectations. Especially the AI zoom... People were surprised when they saw the quality of images and videos this camera delivers. Lastly, the water resistance.... Today I went to WoW Waterpark and took the phone with me in all the rides... Suffice to say not a single issue with the phone and the videos are top notch. Anyone looking to buy a good mid range phone should definitely buy this without giving a second thought. Moto has really outdone itself with this model.\n",

The performance is on par for the segment, and there is absolutely no lag for day to day standard usage. The phone does get warm during some operations, but it is well within the limit.  The only negative is that the curved edge sometimes results in touch related issues. It happens only in some conditions of holding the phone in some specific way, and it's difficult to pinpoint the exact reason.\n",

The charger is a big one, you need to buy an adapter, else it touches the switches.  User interface, need to adjust I was an apple user.  Curved display is a great experience. Flipkart experience is somewhat bad. Due to delay in delivery Many a times. Overall it's good purchase\n",

IP 65 and great build quality 5. Decent cameras  Cons: 1. Camera app does not load quickly. Not sure if it's a bug but it takes too long to launch camera. 2. The processor is average. I don't play games but even while processing photos it takes a couple of seconds to prepare the final image.  Overall a decent all round phone which handles your daily tasks pretty neat.\n",

Speaker:- it's louder than my samsung phone.. though I feel vibration at display at full volume.  Camera:- it's good for potrait shots.. camera quality is good for the price.  OS/UI:- clean OS.. with lots of features.. Seamless integration with windows laptop .. really happy with that..  Network: only Airtel 5G does not work.. a big drawback.. other 5G are fine.. wifi and bluetooth are okay too.  Storage: even though ufs 2.2 but speed is good. Better than lot of ufs 3.1..  Battery:- I m writing this review after 12 hrs of not plugged into the charger.. still left with around 50% battery  Charging. 15w wireless.. 68w wired.  Overall a very good phone for this price.

      "Rating: 4, Review: Writing a review after using it for more than a week.  1. In the current situation, we are having a bigger lag issue in camera opening to capture any photo. I am not sure if there will be a future sw update for the same.  2. I was not expecting that there will be some hang issue which is still there on the phone.  3. Battery performance is ok and i am able to run it for one day including my office emails, calls etc.  4. Screen resolutions and its display is very good and i like the performance of this one.  5. The sound quality i did not like as of now and not feeling for anything of Dolby sound, might be some software update will fix this.  6. Another issue found today which is related to heating when i have used the camera for a long time to capture photos for a long time in a party. And also due to the heat camera app was getting off itself.  7. The touch is very smooth in operating this phone.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: After purchasing this phone, you will truly appreciate its value. At this price point, it offers everything you need. The display is exceptional, and with Gorilla Glass protection, you won't have to worry about durability. The phone's design is both premium and slim, providing a great in-hand feel making it seem like you're holding a high-end device. The camera is outstanding for this price range, with the ability to capture stunning portraits using the 3x telephoto lens (85mm), and the 3x zoom on the normal camera delivers superb photo quality. Performance is also strong, thanks to the Snapdragon 7 Gen 1 processor.  Issues (These can be addressed in future software updates): - The camera app takes a significant amount of time to open. - Photo processing time is longer than expected after capturing an image. - Battery optimisation needs improvement, as there is a noticeable battery drain even when the screen is off.\n",

      "Rating: 4, Review: The camera is mind-blowing. I just shared an image of moon with 30x hand held...the result is beyond my expectations.. battery has improved a lot after 3 weeks of use...camera lags sometimes , so you need patience... otherwise it's brilliant...app installing time is very less too...But I have personally found some cons that no one mentioned and that is pretty much important for me. 1. Spot colour image and video : G85 with price 18k has these two feature in camera, edge 50 fusion and pro both have these features. But out of nowhere moto decided to omit these from edge 50.😑😑 2. Battery capacity could have been a little more optimized, although improved after 3 weeks of use. 3. No Always on Display despite thousands of users ' continuous request.😔😔 4. At the beginning haptic vibration was feeling off after using samsung device, but set the vibration level to low to cope up with this , at least it helped me. No major heating issue, i am not gamer. Warms up while using camera, jittery camera operation, otherwise it's fine.\n",

Drawbacks:- Heating issue while using a camera for a bit longer, which is quite easy to understand with this much quality as well as while charging because it has an ultra charging system so it's also acceptable.

      "Rating: 4, Review: Decent good light weight phone (do not expect more). Got this mobile on 2nd release without having any user reviews, So far all good with 1. battery 5k mah serves a day 2. Performance is fast (Max ram utilized, 256 gb majority of the pre-installed apps consumed). Android 14 is much better and secure with Google 3. Design is good and light weight 4. Display and fingerprint are fine  5. Camera okay (didn't meet our expectations) 6. Memory slot should have been provided  Overall 4/5, you can go for it!  To Flipkart, you charge 59 for secure package but what secure it is ? Mobile came in a normal cart box without any protection like bubble wrap or bubble gels inside box to protect device. Potential chances of damages and tampering of cart box easily. Needs improvement with packing secure.\n",

Camera is perfect. You can capture perfect picture in this price range. 3. Network connection is perfect. Having no any issue related network. 4. Display - it's ok. Needs some more colour detailing in this price range but overall perfect.There is no much more use of peak brightness it's all are advertising propoganda. 5. Heating - After playing more than 1 hrs of BGMI face no any heating issue. Little bit hit which is accepted.   Cons  1. Battery backup is little bit disappointed. Need some more improvement. It's seem as like 5000 mah battery. I has been using poco m2 pro since 4 yrs (5000mah)who provide same battery backup. 2. Haptic is not as like OnePlus provide.need some more improvement. 3. Fingerprint response is slightly slow. You need to place your finger for some second to unlock and fingerprint sensor is bottom of the screen which quite difficult to open the lock. 4. Speaker loudness is low and provide single stereo speaker which is quite disappointing. At least give dual stereo speaker. But the voice clarity is good. 5. Quality of back cover is low.\n",

      "Rating: 4, Review: I am writing review after using 4 days.  Pros  1. Design is awesome. Feel very light weight and very sleek design. Feel very comfortable and have perfect grip. 2. Camera is perfect. You can capture perfect picture in this price range. 3. Network connection is perfect. Having no any issue related network. 4. Display - it's ok. Needs some more colour detailing in this price range but overall perfect.There is no much more use of peak brightness it's all are advertising propoganda. 5. Heating - After playing more than 1 hrs of BGMI face no any heating issue. Little bit hit which is accepted.   Cons  1. Battery backup is little bit disappointed. Need some more improvement. It's seem as like 5000 mah battery. I has been using poco m2 pro since 4 yrs (5000mah)who provide same battery backup. 2. Haptic is not as like OnePlus provide.need some more improvement. 3. Fingerprint response is slightly slow. You need to place your finger for some second to unlock and fingerprint sensor is bottom of the screen which quite difficult to open the lock. 4. Speaker loudness is low and provide single stereo speaker which is quite disappointing. At least give dual stereo speaker. But the voice clarity is good. 5. Quality of back cover is low.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: Perfect phone under the budget of 25k. Display, camera, look, everything is awesome. The battery backup is really really great.

      "Rating: 4, Review: I am writing review after using 4 days.  Pros  1. Design is awesome. Feel very light weight and very sleek design. Feel very comfortable and have perfect grip. 2. Camera is perfect. You can capture perfect picture in this price range. 3. Network connection is perfect. Having no any issue related network. 4. Display - it's ok. Needs some more colour detailing in this price range but overall perfect.There is no much more use of peak brightness it's all are advertising propoganda. 5. Heating - After playing more than 1 hrs of BGMI face no any heating issue. Little bit hit which is accepted.   Cons  1. Battery backup is little bit disappointed. Need some more improvement. It's seem as like 5000 mah battery. I has been using poco m2 pro since 4 yrs (5000mah)who provide same battery backup. 2. Haptic is not as like OnePlus provide.need some more improvement. 3. Fingerprint response is slightly slow. You need to place your finger for some second to unlock and fingerprint sensor is bottom of the screen which quite difficult to open the lock. 4. Speaker loudness is low and provide single stereo speaker which is quite disappointing. At least give dual stereo speaker. But the voice clarity is good. 5. Quality of back cover is low.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: Perfect phone under the budget of 25k. Display, camera, look, everything is awesome. The battery backup is really really great.

      "Rating: 5, Review: Very Powerful Processor, Impressive Cameras- Front And Rear- Could Even Be A Contender To S23 FE Except Probably Only Video Stabilization, Curved But Stunning and Crisp Display, and Reliable Battery After Optimization/Updates.  After a few days of usage, I can tell that the phone is pretty powerful in terms of performance. I did not experience any lags. The display is stunning and clear but the curved screen is not something I am a big fan of generally. The cameras are really good with detailed shots turning up on both front and rear cameras. There are also a ton of features to be explored. Even the videos are decent thanks to OIS and stabilization. Night mode also seemed quite powerful. If you take into account both front and rear cameras, it might as well be a contender to Samsung S23 FE. Battery life initially seemed poor, as though it were draining fast, but with a few personal tweaks and perhaps updates, the battery life has gotten better. Now, it feels reliable.  My only complaints would be the lack of a hybrid SIM slot for microSD support. A 3.5 mm jack would have been nice.  Overall, a very balanced and capable smartphone to buy in the 30k price segment. You can compare this one with Motorola Edge 50 Pro, Samsung S23 FE, One Plus Nord 4, and Realme GT 6T before buying this one because they are all very good as well.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Very Powerful Processor, Impressive Cameras- Front And Rear- Could Even Be A Contender To S23 FE Except Probably Only Video Stabilization, Curved But Stunning and Crisp Display, and Reliable Battery After Optimization/Updates.  After a few days of usage, I can tell that the phone is pretty powerful in terms of performance. I did not experience any lags. The display is stunning and clear but the curved screen is not something I am a big fan of generally. The cameras are really good with detailed shots turning up on both front and rear cameras. There are also a ton of features to be explored. Even the videos are decent thanks to OIS and stabilization. Night mode also seemed quite powerful. If you take into account both front and rear cameras, it might as well be a contender to Samsung S23 FE. Battery life initially seemed poor, as though it were draining fast, but with a few personal tweaks and perhaps updates, the battery life has gotten better. Now, it feels reliable.  My only complaints would be the lack of a hybrid SIM slot for microSD support. A 3.5 mm jack would have been nice.  Overall, a very balanced and capable smartphone to buy in the 30k price segment. You can compare this one with Motorola Edge 50 Pro, Samsung S23 FE, One Plus Nord 4, and Realme GT 6T before buying this one because they are all very good as well.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Very Powerful Processor, Impressive Cameras- Front And Rear- Could Even Be A Contender To S23 FE Except Probably Only Video Stabilization, Curved But Stunning and Crisp Display, and Reliable Battery After Optimization/Updates.  After a few days of usage, I can tell that the phone is pretty powerful in terms of performance. I did not experience any lags. The display is stunning and clear but the curved screen is not something I am a big fan of generally. The cameras are really good with detailed shots turning up on both front and rear cameras. There are also a ton of features to be explored. Even the videos are decent thanks to OIS and stabilization. Night mode also seemed quite powerful. If you take into account both front and rear cameras, it might as well be a contender to Samsung S23 FE. Battery life initially seemed poor, as though it were draining fast, but with a few personal tweaks and perhaps updates, the battery life has gotten better. Now, it feels reliable.  My only complaints would be the lack of a hybrid SIM slot for microSD support. A 3.5 mm jack would have been nice.  Overall, a very balanced and capable smartphone to buy in the 30k price segment. You can compare this one with Motorola Edge 50 Pro, Samsung S23 FE, One Plus Nord 4, and Realme GT 6T before buying this one because they are all very good as well.\n",

Portrait and night mode is really exceptional but again color science is not upto the mark in other departments. Battery is long lasting however drains quickly with respect to it's size. Charging is quick Software is mostly clean.

There are better display panels in market with Lil higher range like One plus 12 or Realme GT6 or Xiaomi 13 phones.  Infact Vivo V40 display is tuned differently and is better than T3 ultra.  Some bloatware available but can be uninstalled.  Cooling mgmt is much better than many phones.  This is not a Camera phone but that's okay. Edit your pictures or videos later.  Best part about phone is it's very comfortable for hands. Your fingers (Pinky) or thumb or any other doesn't get strained.  Meditek processor giving smooth experience  Speakers are also good.  No Dolby or HDR display on OTTs like Netflix.  Overall value for money.\n",

      "Rating: 3, Review: It's performance and battery phone. Display though 1.5 k amoled it is not tuned for comfort. Eyes gets hurt. There are better display panels in market with Lil higher range like One plus 12 or Realme GT6 or Xiaomi 13 phones.  Infact Vivo V40 display is tuned differently and is better than T3 ultra.  Some bloatware available but can be uninstalled.  Cooling mgmt is much better than many phones.  This is not a Camera phone but that's okay. Edit your pictures or videos later.  Best part about phone is it's very comfortable for hands. Your fingers (Pinky) or thumb or any other doesn't get strained.  Meditek processor giving smooth experience  Speakers are also good.  No Dolby or HDR display on OTTs like Netflix.  Overall value for money.\n",

      "Rating: 4, Review: I've been using the Vivo V30 Pro for four months, and while its performance is impressive, it tends to overheat during video calls and gaming, which can lead to call drops. The 5000mAh battery doesn't last as long as expected and requires frequent recharges. However, it cools down quickly once the intensive activity stops. On the bright side, the camera quality is excellent, capturing DSLR-like photos with vibrant colors and sharp details.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Product heting\n",
      "Rating: 4, Review: Writing this review after a month's use. The only pros that I've experienced on this phone are the superior camera and display quality. But a lot of scope for improvement when it comes to user experience, OS functionality, processor performance, sound quality and battery performance.I've used miui and oxygen OS before, and when it comes to user friendliness, funtouch is still way behind them even at this price range. Definitely not a gaming phone, there are slight lags even when I play very basic games like Alto's Odyssey. So you can imagine what will happen if you're a heavy gamer. A huge letdown when it comes to sound quality as it has mono speaker (at this price range!!). I tried playing the same song on this phone and my old redmi note 9 pro max(which costed 18k), and at full volume note 9 totally overpowered the sound coming out from this device. Sound quality gets better with enhancement options only when you're using your earphones.  Personal Verdict: Go for this phone if the camera and display are your primary attraction, and you want a phone that looks sleek and premium on your hands. Also, I got it at a fair amount of discount (almost 10k), so that helps as a consolation.  NB: Terrible delivery experience, Flipkart took a lifetime to deliver the product as it was an exchange offer.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: This was the first time I bought this costly product from VIVO. But it's worth it! Pros: 1. It has 5g 2. Good performance 3. Satisfying camera 4. Immersive display and touch 5. 80w fast charging Cons: 1. Battery drains bit faster while using 5G 2. Sometimes the camera isn't consistent in background colours 3. Fingerprint sensor sometimes doesn't work well  At the end : it's a good camera and good performance phone (if u don't have problem with little battery drains)\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Just Wow. Camera is mind blowing. This camera centric phone won't allow you to feel that you don't own a DSLR. It is indeed a Pocket- DSLR. It's large curved display is good for multimedia experience. It's Single Speaker is quite louder. Battery will go all day long. The Fast Charger takes around 45 mins to charge fully from 20%. Software experience is also good. Android 14 and Funtouch OS 14 out of the box. The UI is nearly Bloatware free. In Looks and Design, it overshadows other premium phones available in the market in this price range.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Best phone at this price range, writing this review after 3 weeks of usage. I have been a long loyal user of Samsung and was hesitant to buy Vivo. My wife convinced me to buy Vivo somehow. I'll compare it with my earlier Samsung M30s which was approx in a similar price range (22k) while Vivo was for (25k)  1. Looks- it is stunning in your hand, no other phone can come close to this. Sleek, curve display, marble finish back cover. The flashlight is in a ring shape, when you ON it in the dark, it looks stunning.wether it's day or night, this thing in your hand would steal the show. 2. Display- wider, larger, brighter. Better than Samsung in the price range of 25-30k. 3 Battery- 1 full charge remains around 15-17hours,which is better than most of the phones in this range. Also, fast charging, in 30-35mins goes from 0-100. In Samsung I had to have at least 2.30hrs recharge for full charge and battery used to drain in 10-12hrs of normal usage. 4. Performance - no lag issues. So smooth to use. I have transferred all my data from my earlier Samsung handset, and yet it is working smoothly. While my Samsung had started to lag and process slowly, this is with every Samsung of 30k below price range. Since, it is too early, I'm keeping my fingers crossed. As of now, I'm very happy with my decision to switch to Vivo, let's see, after 5-6 months of usage.\n",
      "Rating: 4, Review: I am writing this review after using the phone more than 10 days. My opinion regarding the phone is: Pros: Display: Amoled Curved display is mesmerizing. Display is clearly visible in direct sunlight. Camera: camera is very good. It takes vivid images in the daylight . Night camera is above average. Performance: performance is super fast. Apps opening time is very fast. Design: design is very attractive. Glass panel at the back is very worthy. The phone is very light weight. It weighs only 175 grams. Moreover the phone very slim. Only 7.36 mm. Charging: charging time is very fast. It takes only 57 minutes to charge it completely Call recording: you can record call without informing the person on the other end Cons: Battery: with medium usage, with Bluetooth hotspots and mobile data on, with always display on, it lasts only 8 hours while my previous phone lasted for almost a day. Battery heats up a little bit with heavy usage. Although it is not a matter of concern . Software: The software is lag free . But I am missing some features . Themes are not free  My opinion: At this price point, overall it is a complete package. You can go for it\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Honest review after using this smartphone for 1 week  1. Performance - This device is a beast when it comes to performance, No heating issues, you can do gaming easily. Packed with amazing features. 2. Display - Display is mind blowing, the colour it produces is close to natural and little on the saturated side, If you watch a lot of series and movies, you'll love the display 3. Design - The in hand feeling of this device is amazing, it's super slim and super light. Feels premium and top notch. 4. Camera - You can expect a great camera with a lot of detailing and the night option produces very good images. 5. Battery - When you look at the specs, you'll find that the back up will not be up to the mark but trust me the software optimisation is on point. If you are a regular user who uses it for normal usage then it will give you backup for almost 1.5 days. But if you are a gaming and streaming user, the screen time will be 8-10 hours easily. The plus point is 66W flash charger which will charge your device from 0-100 in 50 minutes maximum. CONCLUSION I recommend this device to every kind of user who is looking for a beast under 25K, Vivo has done a great Job. Just don't think about the competition and go for it. The biggest competitor is Moto Edge which has battery drainage issue.\n",

Very much satisfied in terms of looks, camera, design, display. Just go for it. Initially I was waiting for Motorola Edge 40 Neo but it was unavailable and thank God it was unavailable as I heard that edge 40 neo has some heating issue.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Using this phone from tomorrow.  Weight and thickness  In hande fell is amazing and totally like holding a premium phone .  Weight and thickness is unexpected like this.it is really very comfortable to hold the phone with one hand . Overall 10 /10 .   Design and look.  I am purchased dune gold colour which is amazing not expected like this .  Look is best part of this phone  10/10..   Camera I haven't use so much camera till now but I can say it has one of the best camera in 30000 segment.  Rear camera is best Front is better than other phone  10/10.   Software experience  So first this phone has some bloteware that you have to remove it  So many privacy settings that you will have to off those settings because they are related to you google account and personal data  Also ads  But it has so many good features like Dual app Screen short Screen recording Call recording without any announcement App lock Always on display So many things  Now I can told you software experience Is good but not best because of bloteware  7.5/10  Display  Display is best looks is amazing Curved Display phones are really very comfortable and nice looking phone  120hz Display is so smooth like butter  Overall I can say Display is best  10/10  Charging  You will get 66 watt fast charger in this phone That is to fast It take around 48 mins to charge 0 to 100  It slightly gets hot while charging  But at the time of it won't  Charging is best  9.5/10  Performance  It has deminsity 7200 processor Which is based on 4nm  Which consume less battery than other phone  Performance is amazing No any lag  And bgmi is remaining but after some days I will write  10/10  Gaming experience is amazing no lag ,just little bit heating after 1hour of Gaming without any fan or ac in a room  But I tried bgmi in front of fan phone didn't heat 10/10  Battery Battery is good for normal use . If u use 5g in your phone it will consume more Battery than 4g network You can use it around 6 to 7 hours with 5g  9/ 10\n",

From my side gaming performance is good but I don't think it is for hard core gaming. But ya I played bgmi for 3hrs it didn't lag even I have not use the gaming mode .  **Display is excellent.  **Battery backup is good . If you play bgmi constantly battery will run for 5-6 hrs. And for normal use at half brightness battery backup for 8-10 hrs as per your use.  **Connectivity is good I am getting 5g in Airtel.  So, over all a good allrounder phone . For hard core gamer you can look for othe options like poco etc .  Hope my review will help you😅.\n",

      "Rating: 2, Review: Feedback on Mobile Performance Issue  Subject: Issue with Mobile Hanging and Performance  Dear Oppo Reno 12 pro,  I recently purchased a new [Mobile Model] and have been experiencing performance issues that are affecting its usability. The phone frequently hangs, becomes unresponsive, and does not operate as smoothly as expected from a new device. This happens even when running basic apps, and it greatly disrupts my experience.  Here are the key issues I am facing:  Frequent freezing or hanging of the device.  Slow response time when switching between apps.  Occasional crashes during normal usage.   I have already tried common troubleshooting steps like restarting the phone, closing background apps, clearing cache, and checking for software updates. Unfortunately, these actions have not resolved the problem.  Given that this is a new phone, I kindly request your assistance in resolving this issue or suggest possible solutions. If needed, I am open to a replacement or repair under warranty.  Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your prompt response.  Sincerely, Sameer khan\n",

      "Rating: 2, Review: Feedback on Mobile Performance Issue  Subject: Issue with Mobile Hanging and Performance  Dear Oppo Reno 12 pro,  I recently purchased a new [Mobile Model] and have been experiencing performance issues that are affecting its usability. The phone frequently hangs, becomes unresponsive, and does not operate as smoothly as expected from a new device. This happens even when running basic apps, and it greatly disrupts my experience.  Here are the key issues I am facing:  Frequent freezing or hanging of the device.  Slow response time when switching between apps.  Occasional crashes during normal usage.   I have already tried common troubleshooting steps like restarting the phone, closing background apps, clearing cache, and checking for software updates. Unfortunately, these actions have not resolved the problem.  Given that this is a new phone, I kindly request your assistance in resolving this issue or suggest possible solutions. If needed, I am open to a replacement or repair under warranty.  Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your prompt response.  Sincerely, Sameer khan\n",

      "Rating: 2, Review: Feedback on Mobile Performance Issue  Subject: Issue with Mobile Hanging and Performance  Dear Oppo Reno 12 pro,  I recently purchased a new [Mobile Model] and have been experiencing performance issues that are affecting its usability. The phone frequently hangs, becomes unresponsive, and does not operate as smoothly as expected from a new device. This happens even when running basic apps, and it greatly disrupts my experience.  Here are the key issues I am facing:  Frequent freezing or hanging of the device.  Slow response time when switching between apps.  Occasional crashes during normal usage.   I have already tried common troubleshooting steps like restarting the phone, closing background apps, clearing cache, and checking for software updates. Unfortunately, these actions have not resolved the problem.  Given that this is a new phone, I kindly request your assistance in resolving this issue or suggest possible solutions. If needed, I am open to a replacement or repair under warranty.  Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your prompt response.  Sincerely, Sameer khan\n",

      "Rating: 4, Review: The camera is awesome. Battery back up is quite poor, especially with 5g network, but for casual use enough for one day. Charging is lightning fast. The display is nice. The overall experience is really very good. The price is slightly on the higher side but can be purchased with some great offers and exchange as well. I am posting a quick review after one week of use. Later I will write a detailed review.\n",
      "Rating: 4, Review: It's ok in all aspects but not quite ok in terms of overload. All in all ok. But at this price there was much more to ask for. So four out of five.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: It's an amazing mobile. I have used many mobiles but never used the Oppo mobiles. The Camera quality is excellent specially in Potrait mode. Display is also good, no heating problem, charging is very fast it's take only 30-40min to full charge, processor is also working excellent. But only one thing I can say that the Battery of 4600mah is slightly low as per my point of view. If it would be better the battery will be 5000mah. Rest all are Ok.\n",

      "Rating: 5, Review: Nice phone. Battery could have been 5000 Mah and processor could have been 8 plus generation. Camera quality is good, captures good images at day light.\n",
      "Rating: 5, Review: Awesome phone  I am writing the review after almost a week of use. Pros: 1. Very good design both in front and back. 2. Lightweight and feels premium in your hand. 3. Beautiful display, treat to your eyes AMOLED, curved screen and 120hz adaptive refresh rate adds to its beauty. 4. Front camera- beautiful, Sony imx 709 really takes beautiful pics in every condition. Back camera: Main camera really works even in low light condition and 32 MP telephoto lens is not a gimmick. It really helps in taking clear pics of distant objects. 5. IR blaster, NFC is there but not making big difference for me.  Cons: 1. Processor: 778G, really in 39k, feels like 20k processor to me. Even a lower priced Reno 10 has a better clocked (2.6GHZ) processor. I was expecting at least dimensity 8200 in this price range. 2. Single speaker. At this price it should have been Dolby Atmos. 3. Battery: 4600 mah is ok ok for me as I am not a gamer and for normal day to day use it lasts one day easily but 5000 could have been better. 4. No IP rating in this price range is a big disappointment.  Even after the drawbacks I gave it a 5* for its design, display and camera. I got the phone at a good bank discount and a handsome exchange offer. I preferred it over Nord 3 for its camera performance and Nord 3's display problem. Overall Its a good buy.\n",

      "Rating: 4, Review: phone is working good, somethings are as expected, somethings could be better. good phone for camera and also gaming, with enough space and good ram. only problem some might have , is not having sd card slot and nor headphone jack, so one must rely on external storage drive using otg for extra space and a bluetooth headphone (gaming headphone is advised). and obviously batter could be improved, but if charging twice a day is not a problem ,then this wont be a problem ,it wont last 24 hrs, but is good enough for the daytime out and charging agn after reaching home. carrying power bank is advisable. during gaming phone heats up nice(the one that uses semiconductor cooling method is advised), so using phone cooler is also advisable(the one that uses semiconductor cooling method is advised). as for processing power and smoothness and looks and design the phone is definitely as expected. auto network sim change between sim1 and 2 for better network suppport is also helpful. also has NFC facily, that is useful. fingerprint sensor and face unlock work as expected as well.\n",

Camera quality is just like 5-7k phone. There is no premium features at all. Don't expect much from this. If you are taking this at 26-28 in big billion days even then don't purchase it . Invest smartly in good phone with lot of specs\n",
